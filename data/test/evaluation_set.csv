Type,Question,Answer
Content Retrieval,What are the four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience?,"The four categories are: Standard JavaScript errors, system errors, user-specified errors, and AssertionErrors."
Content Retrieval,What happens if an asynchronous method returns a promise and it is rejected in Node.js errors?,"If an asynchronous method returns a promise and that promise is rejected in Node.js, the assert.rejects() function can be used to test this behavior. It returns a rejected Promise with the error that caused the rejection. If the provided function does not return a promise, assert.rejects() itself rejects with an ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE error. In both cases, no internal error handler is invoked—it’s up to the test or calling code to manage the rejection."
Content Retrieval,What is the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors?,The error.code property is a string label that identifies the kind of error and is the most stable way to identify an error across Node.js versions.
Content Retrieval,What is the default value of Error.stackTraceLimit in Node.js?,"The default value is 10, but it can be set to any valid JavaScript number."
Content Retrieval,What does the EMFILE error in Node.js indicate?,The `EMFILE` error in Node.js occurs when the maximum number of file descriptors allowed by the system is reached.
Content Retrieval,What does the ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE error in Node.js indicate?,It indicates that an attempt was made to read a file whose size is larger than the maximum allowed size for a Buffer.
Content Retrieval,What is the meaning of the ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error in Node.js?,It means that an attempt was made to operate on a socket that has already been closed.
Content Retrieval,What does the ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS error in Node.js signify?,"It signifies that HTTP/1 connection-specific headers were used in HTTP/2 requests or responses, which is forbidden."
Content Retrieval,What is the stability rating of the node:assert module in Node.js?,"The stability rating is ""2 - Stable."""
Content Retrieval,What is the default behavior of assert.deepEqual() in legacy assertion mode when comparing objects with different prototypes in Node.js?,"In legacy assertion mode, assert.deepEqual() ignores prototypes, so objects with different prototypes may still pass the assertion."
Content Retrieval,What does the ERR_ASSERTION error code indicate in Node.js assert?,"The ERR_ASSERTION error code indicates that an assertion has failed, signaling an exceptional logic violation."
Content Retrieval,What is the purpose of the stackStartFn parameter in assert.fail() Node.js?,The stackStartFn parameter in assert.fail() allows you to omit stack frames above the specified function from the stack trace.
Content Retrieval,What happens if you pass a non-string value as the first argument to assert.match() in Node.js?,"If a non-string value is passed as the first argument to assert.match(), an AssertionError is thrown with the message: ""The 'string' argument must be of type string."""
Content Retrieval,"What is the issue number for the fix related to ""diagnoseCorruption should not throw Unexpected type of BlockId for ShuffleBlockBatchId” in Apache Spark?",The issue number is SPARK-43242.
Content Retrieval,What issue is addressed by SPARK-44581 in Apache Spark?,SPARK-44581 addresses the bug where ShutdownHookManager gets the wrong UGI from the SecurityManager of ApplicationMaster.

Content Retrieval,What accessibility improvement was made for decorative SVGs?,"The attribute aria-hidden=""true"" was added to decorative SVGs to improve accessibility."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the error.info property in Node.js errors, and how is it used?","The error.info property in Node.js errors is used to provide additional details about the error condition. It is an object that contains extra information about the error, such as the error code or a human-readable description of the error. This property is particularly useful in system errors, where it helps to provide more context about the error, which can be essential for debugging and error handling."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does error handling differ between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js?,"Synchronous APIs handle errors using throw and try...catch, while asynchronous APIs report errors via Promises, callbacks, or 'error' events."
Content Retrieval Complex,Why is the error.code property more stable than error.message in nodejs?,"The error.code property is more stable because it only changes between major versions, whereas error.message is more variable and less consistent."
Content Retrieval Complex,What should be done in nodejs errors if an asynchronous method returns a Promise?,"If an asynchronous method returns a Promise, you should always handle the possibility that it might be rejected, for example, using .catch() or try...catch with await."
Content Retrieval Complex,What happens if no 'error' event handler is provided for an EventEmitter in nodejs?,"If no 'error' event handler is provided for an EventEmitter, the error will cause the Node.js process to crash unless a handler for 'uncaughtException' is registered."
Content Retrieval Complex,"How does Node.js handle errors that occur within asynchronous APIs, and what mechanisms are available for error propagation?","Node.js handles errors in asynchronous APIs through several mechanisms: errors can be propagated via rejected Promises, callback functions (where the first argument is an Error object), or 'error' events on EventEmitter objects. These mechanisms ensure that errors are reported and can be handled appropriately, preventing the Node.js process from crashing."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js, and why is it preferred over error.message for identifying errors?","The error.code property provides a stable string label that identifies the type of error, making it ideal for programmatic error handling. Unlike error.message, which can change between minor versions, error.code only changes between major versions, ensuring consistency and reliability when identifying and handling specific errors."
Content Retrieval Complex,What is the difference between assert.deepEqual() and assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js?,"assert.deepEqual() uses the == operator for comparison, which allows coercion (e.g., 1 == '1'), while assert.deepStrictEqual() uses Object.is(), which performs strict equality checks (e.g., 1 !== '1'). assert.deepStrictEqual() is recommended for more reliable assertions."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does assert.throws() validate errors in Node.js?,"assert.throws() allows you to specify an error validation mechanism, such as a Class, RegExp, validation function, or object. It checks that the function throws an error matching the specified criteria, throwing an AssertionError if the validation fails."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of assert.CallTracker in Node.js, and why is it deprecated?","assert.CallTracker is used to track whether functions are called a specific number of times. It is deprecated because it is no longer recommended for use, and alternatives like mock helper functions are suggested instead."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does assert.partialDeepStrictEqual() differ from assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js?,"assert.partialDeepStrictEqual() only compares properties that exist on the expected parameter, making it useful for partial comparisons. In contrast, assert.deepStrictEqual() requires all properties to match exactly, including those not present in the expected object."
Content Retrieval Complex,What happens if assert.ok() is called without any arguments?,"If assert.ok() is called without arguments, it throws an AssertionError with the message: ""No value argument passed to assert.ok()"". This ensures that the function is used correctly and that a truthy value is provided for validation."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does the assert.deepStrictEqual() method handle comparisons of WeakMap and WeakSet objects in Node.js?,"The assert.deepStrictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of WeakMap and WeakSet objects by checking their structure rather than their contents. Since WeakMap and WeakSet do not rely on their values for comparison, the method only verifies that the objects are instances of WeakMap or WeakSet and do not compare their internal entries."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the stackStartFn parameter in the assert.fail() method, and how does it affect the error message?","The stackStartFn parameter in the assert.fail() method allows you to specify a function that, if provided, causes the generated stack trace to omit all frames up to this function. This helps in truncating the stack trace to start from a specific point, making the error message more focused on the relevant part of the code."
Content Retrieval Complex,Why is it recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode?,"It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because strict mode provides more reliable and precise comparisons. Legacy mode uses the Abstract Equality Comparison (==), which can lead to surprising results due to coercion (e.g., 1 == '1'). In contrast, strict mode uses the SameValue Comparison (Object.is()), which performs strict equality checks and is less prone to unexpected behavior."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors, and how is it used in assertions?","The error.code property in Node.js errors is a string label that identifies the type of error. It is used in assertions to provide a stable way to identify and handle specific errors. For example, in the assert module, the error.code property is set to 'ERR_ASSERTION' to indicate that the error is an assertion error."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does the assert.rejects() function in Node.js handle cases where the async function throws an error synchronously?,"The assert.rejects() function in Node.js handles cases where the async function throws an error synchronously by returning a rejected Promise with that error. If the function does not return a Promise, assert.rejects() returns a rejected Promise with an ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE error, skipping the error handler."
Content Retrieval Complex,What is the difference between assert.doesNotThrow() and assert.doesNotReject() in Node.js?,"The difference between assert.doesNotThrow() and assert.doesNotReject() in Node.js is that assert.doesNotThrow() checks that a synchronous function does not throw an error, while assert.doesNotReject() checks that an asynchronous function (or Promise) does not reject. Both functions ensure that errors are handled appropriately, but they operate in different contexts (synchronous vs. asynchronous)."
Content Retrieval Complex,How does the assert.strictEqual() method in Node.js handle comparisons of NaN values?,"The assert.strictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of NaN values by using the SameValue Comparison (Object.is()). Since NaN is considered identical to itself (NaN !== NaN is false), the method treats NaN values as equal when compared with each other."
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the generatedMessage property in the assert.AssertionError class, and when is it set to true?","The generatedMessage property in the assert.AssertionError class indicates whether the error message was automatically generated by the assertion function. It is set to true when the message is auto-generated by the system, such as when using assert.strictEqual(). If a custom message is provided, this property is set to false."
Version-Specific Content Retrieval,What type of release is Apache Spark 2.4.7?,"Spark 2.4.7 is a maintenance release containing stability, correctness, and security fixes."
Version-Specific Content Retrieval,What is the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 23.11.0?,"In Node.js v23.11.0, the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method is 1_2 - Release candidate."
