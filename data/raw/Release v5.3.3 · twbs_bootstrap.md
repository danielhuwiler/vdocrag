v5.3.3

6e1f75f

Highlights

Fixed a breaking change introduced with color modes where it was required to
manually import  variables-dark.scss  when building Bootstrap with Sass. Now,
_variables.scss  will automatically import  _variables-dark.scss . If you were
already importing  _variables-dark.scss  manually, you should keep doing it as it
won't break anything and will be the way to go in v6.

Fixed a regression in the selector engine that wasn't able to handle multiple IDs

anymore.

Color modes

Badges now use the  .text-bg-*  text utilities to be certain that the text is always
readable (especially when the customized colors are different in light and dark
modes).

Fixed our  color-modes.js  script to handle the case where the OS is set to light
mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from
our docs, you should apply this change to your own script.

Fixed color schemes description in the color modes documentation to show that
color-scheme()  only accept  light  and  dark  values as parameters.

Miscellaneous

Allowed  <dl> ,  <dt>  and  <dd>  in the sanitizer.
Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers.

Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting

accordions.

Fixed the focus box-shadow for the validation stated form controls.

Fixed the focus ring on focused checked buttons.

Fixed the product example mobile navbar toggler.

Changed the RTL processing of carousel control icons.
