Content Retrieval,What happens if an asynchronous method returns a promise and it is rejected in Node.js errors?,"If an asynchronous method returns a promise and that promise is rejected in Node.js, the assert.rejects() function can be used to test this behavior. It returns a rejected Promise with the error that caused the rejection. If the provided function does not return a promise, assert.rejects() itself rejects with an ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE error.

Content Retrieval Complex,How does error handling differ between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js?,"Synchronous APIs handle errors using throw and try...catch, while asynchronous APIs report errors via Promises, callbacks, or 'error' events.","Error handling in Node.js differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs primarily in how errors are reported.

For **synchronous APIs**, errors are typically reported using `throw`. This means that if an error occurs, it will throw an exception that can be caught using a `try...catch` block.

In contrast, **asynchronous APIs** generally follow an ""error-first callback"" pattern. In this pattern, a callback function is passed as an argument to the asynchronous method. When the operation completes or an error occurs, the callback is invoked with the `Error` object (if any) as the first argument. If there is no error, the first argument is passed as `null`.

In summary, synchronous APIs use `throw` for error handling, while asynchronous APIs use callbacks to handle errors.",0,"Error handling in Node.js differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs primarily in the mechanisms used to report errors.

1. **Synchronous APIs**: These APIs use the `throw` mechanism to raise exceptions, which must be handled using `try…catch`. If an error is thrown and not caught, the Node.js process will exit immediately. An example of a synchronous API is `fs.readFileSync`.

2. **Asynchronous APIs**: Errors in asynchronous APIs can be reported in multiple ways:
   - Most asynchronous methods that accept a callback function will pass an error object to the callback as the first argument, following the error-first callback pattern.
   - Asynchronous APIs may also return a Promise, allowing errors to be handled using `.catch()`.

Additionally, for stream-based and event emitter-based asynchronous APIs, if an `'error'` event handler is not provided, the error will be thrown, causing an uncaught exception that crashes the Node.js process. Thus, error handling mechanisms for asynchronous APIs are more varied and require careful management to avoid uncaught exceptions.",1,"In Node.js, error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs primarily in how errors are reported and managed.

- `assert.deepEqual()` allows for type coercion, meaning it will consider values to be equal even if they are of different types, as long as their values are equivalent. For example, it would consider the number `1` and the string `'1'` to be equal.

- `assert.deepStrictEqual()`, on the other hand, checks for strict equality without type coercion. This means that the number `1` and the string `'1'` would not be considered equal; they must be of the same type and value to pass the assertion.

In summary, use `assert.deepEqual()` for lenient comparisons and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` for strict comparisons.",1,"In Node.js, the difference between `assert.deepEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` lies in how they compare the values of the objects being tested.

1. **assert.deepEqual()**: This method checks for deep equality between two values, meaning it compares the properties of objects recursively. However, it performs type coercion, which means that it will consider values equal even if they are of different types. For example, `assert.deepEqual(1, '1')` would pass because the values are considered equal after coercion.

2. **assert.deepStrictEqual()**: This method also checks for deep equality but does not perform type coercion. It requires that both the value and type of the properties being compared are the same. For instance, `assert.deepStrictEqual(1, '1')` would fail because the types (number vs. string) are different.

In summary, use `assert.deepEqual()` when you want a more lenient comparison that allows for type coercion, and use `assert.deepStrictEqual()` when you need a strict comparison that considers both value and type.",1

This method takes a function as its first argument and checks if it throws an error. If the function does throw an error, `assert.throws()` can also be used to verify that the error matches certain criteria, such as the error type or message.

The method is particularly useful for testing error handling in your code, ensuring that the expected errors are raised under the right conditions. If the function does not throw an error, or if the error does not match the expected criteria, the assertion fails, indicating that the test did not pass.

While the retrieved context does not provide specific details about `assert.throws()`, it is generally understood that it plays a crucial role in unit testing by allowing developers to confirm that their code behaves correctly in the presence of errors.",1

Content Retrieval Complex,Why is it recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode?,"It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because strict mode provides more reliable and precise comparisons. Legacy mode uses the Abstract Equality Comparison (==), which can lead to surprising results due to coercion (e.g., 1 == '1'). In contrast, strict mode uses the SameValue Comparison (Object.is()), which performs strict equality checks and is less prone to unexpected behavior.","It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because legacy mode employs the Abstract Equality Comparison, which can lead to unexpected results. This is particularly evident in functions like `assert.deepEqual()`, where the comparison rules are more lenient.
