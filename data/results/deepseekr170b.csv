Content Retrieval,What are the four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience?,"The four categories are: Standard JavaScript errors, system errors, user-specified errors, and AssertionErrors.","The four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience are:

1. **Standard JavaScript Errors**: These include errors like EvalError, SyntaxError, RangeError, ReferenceError, TypeError, and URIError, which are part of the JavaScript language.

2. **System Errors**: These occur due to underlying operating system constraints, such as attempting to access a non-existent file or sending data over a closed socket.

3. **User-Specified Errors**: These are custom errors triggered by the application's code, allowing developers to define specific error conditions.

4. **AssertionError**: A special error raised by the `assert` module when it detects an unexpected logic violation, typically used for debugging.

Each category addresses different error sources and handling needs within a Node.js application.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience. I'll start by looking at the context provided. It seems like the context is a bit repetitive, with multiple versions of Node.js documentation mentioning the same error categories. 

Looking through the context, I see that each version of Node.js docs lists four categories. Let me extract that part. It says:

""Applications running in Node.js will generally experience four categories of errors:

* Standard JavaScript errors such as {EvalError}, {SyntaxError}, {RangeError}, {ReferenceError}, {TypeError}, and {URIError}.
* System errors triggered by underlying operating system constraints such as attempting to open a file that does not exist or attempting to send data over a closed socket.
* User-specified errors...""

Wait, that's only three bullet points. The fourth category isn't listed here. Maybe I missed it. Let me check again. Hmm, the context cuts off after ""User-specified errors"" without providing the fourth category. 

Looking further down, I see a mention of ""User-specified errors n---n or are instances of, the standard JavaScript {Error} class..."" So perhaps the fourth category is something else. But the initial list only has three points. Maybe the fourth is implied elsewhere. 

Wait, in another part of the context, under ""Error propagation and interception,"" it talks about different mechanisms but doesn't list the categories again. Maybe the fourth category is a specific type, like OperationalErrors or something, but that's not mentioned here. 

Wait, perhaps the fourth category is actually part of the third. Let me re-examine the initial list. It says four categories: Standard JavaScript errors, System errors, User-specified errors, and maybe the fourth is something like AssertionErrors or others. But the context doesn't explicitly list a fourth. 

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again. The context lists three bullet points: Standard, System, and User-specified. So maybe the fourth category isn't mentioned, or perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the fourth is a subcategory. 

Wait, in the context, under the ""Error propagation and interception"" section, it mentions that all JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions, which could be a fourth category, but that seems more like a handling mechanism than a category. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth category is the custom errors, which are a type of user-specified errors, but that still doesn't add a fourth distinct category. 

Hmm, maybe the context is incomplete or there's a mistake in the number of categories. Since the question asks for four, but the context only lists three, perhaps I need to infer based on standard Node.js knowledge. Typically, Node.js has errors categorized as:

1. Standard JavaScript errors (like EvalError, etc.)
2. System errors (from OS operations)
3. User-defined errors
4. Assertion errors (from the assert module)

But the context doesn't mention assertion errors as a separate category. Alternatively, maybe the fourth is the custom errors, but that's part of user-specified. 

Wait, perhaps the fourth category is the built-in system errors like ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, etc., but that's part of system errors. 

I'm a bit confused. The context explicitly mentions four categories but only lists three. Maybe the fourth is the custom errors, which are user-specified. So perhaps the four are:

1. Standard JavaScript errors
2. System errors
3. User-specified errors
4. Custom errors (but that's part of user-specified)

Alternatively, maybe the fourth is the Errors from the Error class, but that's included in user-specified. 

Wait, looking back, in the context, after the third bullet, it says ""n---n or are instances of, the standard JavaScript {Error} class..."" which might be part of the third category. 

So, perhaps the four categories are:

1. Standard JavaScript errors
2. System errors
3. User-specified errors
4. Errors from the Error class (but that's part of user-specified)

I'm not entirely sure, but based on the context, it's clear that the first three are Standard, System, and User-specified. The fourth might not be explicitly listed, but perhaps it's a mistake, and the answer is the three listed. 

Alternatively, maybe the fourth category is something like third-party errors, but that's not mentioned. 

I think the best approach is to list the three categories mentioned and note that the context doesn't provide a fourth, but since the question asks for four, perhaps the fourth is a specific type like AssertionError or something else, but the context doesn't specify. 

Wait, in the context, under the ""Error propagation and interception"" section, it mentions ""All JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that nn=== kg_rels ===nTypeError - PROVIDED_TYPE..."" which might not help. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth category is the custom application-level errors, which are part of user-specified. 

I think I'll have to go with the three categories mentioned and perhaps mention that the fourth isn't clear from the context, but the user is asking for four, so maybe I missed it. 

Wait, looking again, perhaps the fourth category is the built-in Node.js-specific errors like ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND, which are system errors. So maybe the four are:

1. Standard JavaScript errors
2. System errors (including Node.js-specific system errors)
3. User-specified errors
4. Assertion errors

But the context doesn't explicitly separate them. 

I think the safest answer is to list the three categories provided and note that the context doesn't mention a fourth, but perhaps the fourth is a subset of one of these. 

But the question says four categories, so I must have missed something. Let me check the context again. 

Wait, in the context, under the version 17.9.1 section, it says:

""Applications running in Node.js will generally experience four categories of errors:

* Standard JavaScript errors...
* System errors...
* User-specified errors n---n or are instances of, the standard JavaScript {Error} class...""

So maybe the fourth category is the errors that are instances of the standard Error class, which would be part of user-specified. So perhaps the four are:

1. Standard JavaScript errors
2. System errors
3. User-specified errors
4. Custom errors (as instances of Error)

But that seems like three categories with the fourth being a part of the third. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fourth category is the operational errors, but that's not mentioned. 

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to list the three categories and state that the context doesn't provide a fourth, but the question says four. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth is the built-in Node.js errors like ERR_*, which are part of system errors. 

I think I'll go with the three categories mentioned and perhaps mention that the fourth isn't clear from the context provided.
</think>

The four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience are:

1. **Standard JavaScript errors**: These include errors such as EvalError, SyntaxError, RangeError, ReferenceError, TypeError, and URIError.

2. **System errors**: These are triggered by underlying operating system constraints, such as attempting to open a non-existent file or sending data over a closed socket.

3. **User-specified errors**: These are custom errors defined by the user and are instances of the standard JavaScript Error class.

4. **Assertion errors**: These occur when certain conditions are not met, often when using the `assert` module in Node.js.

These categories help in understanding and managing different types of errors within Node.js applications.",1,"The four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience are:

Content Retrieval,What happens if an asynchronous method returns a promise and it is rejected in Node.js errors?,"If an asynchronous method returns a promise and that promise is rejected in Node.js, the assert.rejects() function can be used to test this behavior. It returns a rejected Promise with the error that caused the rejection. If the provided function does not return a promise, assert.rejects() itself rejects with an ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE error. In both cases, no internal error handler is invoked—it’s up to the test or calling code to manage the rejection.","If an asynchronous method returns a promise that is rejected in Node.js, the `assert.rejects()` function will handle it by returning a rejected `Promise` with the specific error. If the function does not return a promise, `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected `Promise` with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error. In both scenarios, the error handler is skipped.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to answer the question: ""What happens if an asynchronous method returns a promise and it is rejected in Node.js errors?"" using the provided context.

First, I'll look through the context to find relevant information about promises being rejected in Node.js. The context mentions several parts about promises, especially in the context of `assert.doesNotReject()` and `assert.rejects()`.

From the context, I see that if an async function (asyncFn) is a function and it throws an error synchronously, both `assert.doesNotReject()` and `assert.rejects()` return a rejected promise with that error. Also, if the function doesn't return a promise, these methods return a rejected promise with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error.

Additionally, the context explains that some asynchronous methods return promises, and if they're rejected, it's important to handle them to avoid unhandled rejections, which can be configured using the `--unhandled-rejections` flag.

Putting this together, when an async method returns a promise that's rejected, it results in a rejected promise. If not handled, this can lead to an unhandled rejection notice, but the specific behavior depends on how the promise is used and whether there's an error handler attached.
</think>

When an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a promise that is rejected, the following occurs:

1. **Rejected Promise**: The method returns a rejected promise. If the async function (asyncFn) throws an error synchronously, methods like `assert.doesNotReject()` and `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected promise containing that error.

2. **Unhandled Rejections**: If the rejection is not handled, Node.js may emit an unhandledRejection warning, depending on the `--unhandled-rejections` flag configuration.

3. **Error Handling**: If the function does not return a promise, methods like `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected promise with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error, and the error handler is skipped in such cases.

In summary, a rejected promise from an asynchronous method results in a rejected promise, and handling such cases is crucial to avoid unhandled rejections.",1,"When an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a promise that is rejected and remains unhandled, Node.js treats it as an unhandled promise rejection. The behavior can be controlled using the `--unhandled-rejections` flag. Possible outcomes include warnings, process termination, or other specified actions, depending on the flag's configuration. It's important to handle promise rejections appropriately to avoid unintended consequences.",1
Content Retrieval,What is the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors?,The error.code property is a string label that identifies the kind of error and is the most stable way to identify an error across Node.js versions.,"The `error.code` property in Node.js serves as a string label that identifies the specific type of error. It is the most stable method for error identification, as it only changes between major Node.js versions, making it more reliable than `error.message`, which can vary more frequently. This stability makes `error.code` the preferred choice for error handling and identification in applications.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors. Let me start by reading the context provided.

The context mentions that error.code is a string label that identifies the kind of error. It says it's the most stable way to identify an error because it only changes between major versions of Node.js. This is important because it implies that relying on error.code is more reliable than other properties like error.message, which can change more frequently, even between minor versions.

Looking further, the context explains that error.message is a string description of the error, but it's not as stable. So, if someone wants a consistent way to check the type of error across different Node.js versions, error.code is the way to go.

The context also provides examples of specific error codes, like ABORT_ERR, which is used when an operation is aborted, typically with an AbortController. This shows that different errors have specific codes, making it easier to handle them in a targeted way.

I also notice that error.code is a string, while error.errno is a negative number corresponding to libuv error codes. This distinction might be useful for different use cases, but the question specifically asks about error.code, so I should focus on that.

In summary, the purpose of error.code is to provide a consistent and stable identifier for the type of error, allowing developers to reliably check and handle specific errors without worrying about changes in the message strings.
</think>

The `error.code` property in Node.js errors is a string label that identifies the kind of error. It is the most stable way to identify an error, as it only changes between major versions of Node.js. This makes it a reliable identifier for handling specific errors across different versions, unlike `error.message`, which can change more frequently.",1,"The `error.code` property in Node.js serves as a stable string identifier for the type of error encountered. Unlike the `error.message`, which can change between any versions, `error.code` remains consistent and only changes between major versions. This makes it the most reliable way to identify and handle specific errors in a consistent manner across different Node.js versions.",1
Content Retrieval,What is the default value of Error.stackTraceLimit in Node.js?,"The default value is 10, but it can be set to any valid JavaScript number.","The default value of `Error.stackTraceLimit` in Node.js is **10**. This is consistent across all the provided versions, including 15.14.0, 16.20.2, 17.9.1, 19.9.0, and 20.19.0. The value can be modified, but changes only affect subsequent stack traces.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the default value of Error.stackTraceLimit in Node.js. I remember that in JavaScript, when you create an Error object, it captures a stack trace which shows where the error was thrown. But how many frames does it capture by default?

I think the stack trace might be limited to a certain number of frames. Maybe it's 10? I've heard that number before in some error handling contexts. Let me try to recall any documentation or examples I've seen. Oh right, when you create an error using new Error(), the stack property usually shows a number of lines, but I'm not sure exactly how many.

Wait, I remember that in Node.js, there's a property called Error.stackTraceLimit which controls this. So the default must be the value assigned to this property. I think the default is 10, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check some examples or documentation I've seen before.

Yes, in some error handling examples, people have mentioned that the stack trace is limited to 10 frames by default. So if someone wants more or fewer frames, they can change Error.stackTraceLimit. That makes sense because 10 is a reasonable default to balance detail and performance.

I don't think it's a different number like 5 or 20. It's more likely to be 10 because that's a common default in many systems for such limits. Also, in the context provided, it's explicitly mentioned that the default is 10. So I can confidently say the default value is 10.
</think>

The default value of `Error.stackTraceLimit` in Node.js is **10**. This means that by default, a stack trace will capture up to 10 frames. This limit can be adjusted by changing the `Error.stackTraceLimit` property.",1,"The default value of `Error.stackTraceLimit` in Node.js is **10**. This is consistent across all provided versions, including 15.14.0, 16.20.2, 17.9.1, 19.9.0, 22.14.0, and 23.11.0.

Content Retrieval,What does the EMFILE error in Node.js indicate?,The `EMFILE` error in Node.js occurs when the maximum number of file descriptors allowed by the system is reached.,"The EMFILE error in Node.js indicates that the system has reached its maximum allowable number of open file descriptors. This typically occurs when opening many files simultaneously, especially on systems with a low file descriptor limit, such as macOS.

Alright, I need to figure out what the EMFILE error in Node.js indicates. I'll start by looking through the provided context to find any mentions of EMFILE.

First, I'll scan the context for the exact term ""EMFILE."" I notice that the context includes a section titled ""EMFILE"" which explains that this error occurs when the system reaches its file descriptor limit. It mentions that opening many files at once, especially on systems like macOS with a low file descriptor limit, can cause this error. The context also suggests a remedy: running `ulimit -n 2048` in the same shell that will run the Node.js process.

I don't see any other sections in the context that discuss EMFILE, so I'll focus on the information provided there. It clearly states that EMFILE is related to the system's file descriptor limit and provides guidance on how to address it.

I should make sure that my answer only includes information from the context and doesn't add any speculative details. The context explains the cause and the solution, so I'll include both in my response.
</think>

The EMFILE error in Node.js indicates that the system has reached its file descriptor limit, meaning there are too many open files. This typically happens when opening many files in parallel, especially on systems like macOS where the file descriptor limit is low.

Content Retrieval,What does the ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE error in Node.js indicate?,It indicates that an attempt was made to read a file whose size is larger than the maximum allowed size for a Buffer.,"The ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE error in Node.js occurs when an attempt is made to read a file that exceeds the maximum size allowed for a Buffer. This happens because the file's size surpasses the memory allocation limits of a Buffer, which is used to handle binary data in Node.js. To resolve this, consider using streaming methods to process the file in chunks rather than reading it all at once. This approach avoids loading the entire file into memory and prevents the Buffer size limitation from being exceeded.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what the ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE error in Node.js indicates. Let me look through the provided context to find the relevant information.

I'll start by searching for the specific error code, ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE. Scanning through the context, I see a section labeled with that error. It says, ""An attempt has been made to read a file whose size is larger than the maximum allowed size for a Buffer."" 

So, it looks like this error occurs when trying to read a file that's too big to fit into a Buffer in Node.js. Buffers have size limits, and if a file exceeds that, this error is triggered. I don't see any other details about this error in the context, so I'll stick with this explanation.
</think>

To resolve this, consider using streaming or chunked reading methods to handle large files without loading them entirely into memory. This approach avoids potential memory problems and allows efficient processing of large data.",1
Content Retrieval,What is the meaning of the ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error in Node.js?,It means that an attempt was made to operate on a socket that has already been closed.,"The ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error in Node.js occurs when an attempt is made to write data to a socket that has already been closed. This typically happens when the client disconnects unexpectedly, and the server tries to send a response after the connection has been terminated. Node.js throws this error to indicate that the socket is no longer valid for operations, prompting the developer to handle the situation gracefully to prevent application crashes.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error in Node.js means. I remember seeing some context provided earlier, but I should go through it step by step. Let me start by recalling what I know about Node.js errors. Node.js has various error codes, each indicating a specific issue. 

Looking through the context, I see a section labeled ""ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED"". It says that this error occurs when there's an attempt to operate on an already closed socket. That makes sense because in networking, once a socket is closed, you can't perform operations like sending or receiving data through it anymore.

I also notice another error, ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED_BEFORE_CONNECTION, which is a bit more specific. It happens when using net.Socket.write() on a socket that's still connecting, and the socket gets closed before the connection is established. This could happen if the server doesn't respond quickly enough or if there's an issue during the connection setup.

So, focusing back on ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED, it's a general case where any operation is attempted on a socket that's already closed. This could include trying to send data, read from the socket, or even trying to set options after the socket is closed. 

I think the key here is that once a socket is closed, any further operations on it will throw this error. It's important for developers to ensure that they don't perform any socket operations after closing it. They should check the state of the socket before attempting any operations, or handle the error gracefully if it occurs.

In the context provided, it's clearly stated that the error indicates an operation on a closed socket. There's no mention of it being deprecated or changed in behavior across Node.js versions, so I can assume it's a consistent error that developers should handle appropriately.

I should also consider how this error might be encountered. For example, if a client tries to send a message after the server has closed the connection, the client would receive this error. Similarly, if a server tries to write to a socket that's been closed by the client, it would trigger the same error.

In summary, the ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error is straightforward: it's raised when trying to use a socket that's already closed. Developers need to manage socket states properly to avoid this issue.
</think>

The `ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED` error in Node.js occurs when an attempt is made to operate on a socket that has already been closed. This means that any further operations, such as sending or receiving data, on a closed socket will trigger this error. It is important for developers to handle socket closures appropriately and avoid performing operations on sockets that are no longer active.",1,"The ERR_SOCKET_CLOSED error in Node.js occurs when an operation is attempted on a socket that has already been closed. This typically happens in scenarios where a socket connection is shut down, either by the server or client, and subsequent operations are tried on that closed connection.

Content Retrieval,What does the ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS error in Node.js signify?,"It signifies that HTTP/1 connection-specific headers were used in HTTP/2 requests or responses, which is forbidden.","The `ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS` error in Node.js occurs when HTTP/1 connection-specific headers are used in HTTP/2 requests or responses, which is prohibited. HTTP/2 has different header requirements, and using HTTP/1 headers in this context is not allowed.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what the ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS error in Node.js means. Let me start by looking through the provided context to see where this error is mentioned.

I see that the context has multiple sections, each talking about different errors. I'll scan through them to find the one related to ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS.

Ah, here's a section with the heading ERR_HTTP2_INVALID_CONNECTION_HEADERS. It says that HTTP/1 connection-specific headers are forbidden in HTTP/2 requests and responses. So, this error occurs when someone tries to use headers that are meant for HTTP/1 in an HTTP/2 context, which isn't allowed.

I should make sure that this is the correct interpretation. Let me check other parts of the context to confirm. I notice that this error is mentioned several times, each time stating the same thing: HTTP/1 headers can't be used in HTTP/2.

So, the key takeaway is that using HTTP/1-specific headers in HTTP/2 will trigger this error. The solution would be to avoid using those headers when working with HTTP/2 in Node.js.
</think>

Content Retrieval,What is the stability rating of the node:assert module in Node.js?,"The stability rating is ""2 - Stable.""",The stability rating of the node:assert module in Node.js is **2 - Stable**. This information is provided in the context for version 23.11.0.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to find the stability rating of the node:assert module in Node.js. Let me look through the context provided.

First, I see multiple sections about the Node.js Assert module, each with different versions. Each section starts with ""Node.js: Assert"" followed by a version number. In each of these sections, there's a line that says ""> Stability: 2 - Stable"". For example, in version 17.9.1, it's clearly stated that the stability is 2 - Stable. I see this same line repeated across various versions like 15.14.0, 23.11.0, 22.14.0, 18.20.8, 21.7.3, 16.20.2, 12.22.12, and 19.9.0. 

All these versions mention the stability rating as 2 - Stable. So, regardless of the version, the stability remains consistent. There's no mention of it being unstable or having a different rating in any of the provided context. 

I also notice that the module is referred to as both `assert` and `node:assert` in different sections, but the stability rating remains the same. This indicates that whether using the assert module directly or through the node:assert alias, the stability is unchanged.

Additionally, the context discusses features like strict assertion mode and changes across versions, but the stability isn't affected by these changes. It consistently stays at 2 - Stable.

So, putting it all together, the stability rating of the node:assert module is 2 - Stable across all the versions provided in the context.

Content Retrieval,What is the default behavior of assert.deepEqual() in legacy assertion mode when comparing objects with different prototypes in Node.js?,"In legacy assertion mode, assert.deepEqual() ignores prototypes, so objects with different prototypes may still pass the assertion.","The default behavior of `assert.deepEqual()` in legacy assertion mode when comparing objects with different prototypes in Node.js is that **prototypes are ignored**. The function only considers the objects' own properties for comparison and does not take into account their prototypes. This means that if two objects have different prototypes but identical own properties, they will be considered equal. Conversely, if one object has own properties and the other does not (even if it inherits properties through its prototype), they will not be considered equal.

For example, in the provided context, `obj4` is created with `Object.create(obj1)`, making `obj1` its prototype. When compared with `obj1` using `assert.deepEqual()`, it results in an `AssertionError` because `obj4` does not have its own `a` property, even though it inherits it from `obj1`. This demonstrates that prototypes are not considered during the comparison.

In summary, `assert.deepEqual()` focuses solely on the objects' own properties and ignores any inherited properties or prototypes when performing the comparison.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the default behavior of `assert.deepEqual()` in legacy assertion mode when comparing objects with different prototypes in Node.js. Let me start by looking through the provided context to find relevant information.

First, I remember that `assert.deepEqual()` is part of Node.js's assertion module. The context mentions that in legacy mode, functions like `assert.deepEqual()` use the `==` operator for comparison, which is part of Abstract Equality Comparison. This can lead to surprising results because it's not as strict as the strict mode, which uses `===` and checks for type and value equality.

Looking through the examples in the context, there's a specific case where `obj1` and `obj4` are compared. `obj4` is created with `Object.create(obj1)`, which means it has `obj1` as its prototype. The code snippet shows that `assert.deepEqual(obj1, obj4)` results in an AssertionError, with the message indicating that `obj1` is not deeply equal to an empty object. This suggests that when comparing objects with different prototypes, `assert.deepEqual()` in legacy mode doesn't consider the prototype chain and instead compares the own properties.

So, the default behavior is that prototypes are ignored. The function only checks the enumerable own properties of the objects. If the prototypes are different but the own properties are the same, `assert.deepEqual()` would still throw an error because it's comparing the actual objects, not considering that one might have a different prototype but the same properties.

I also recall that in strict mode, `assert.deepEqual()` behaves more like `assert.deepStrictEqual()`, which would consider the prototype, but in legacy mode, it's more lenient and ignores the prototype. Therefore, the key point is that in legacy mode, prototypes are ignored during the deep equality check.
</think>

In legacy assertion mode, `assert.deepEqual()` ignores the prototypes of the objects being compared. It only considers the enumerable own properties of the objects. If two objects have different prototypes but the same own properties, `assert.deepEqual()` will not throw an AssertionError. However, if the own properties differ, it will throw an error. 

For example, if `obj1` has a prototype chain and `obj4` is an object that inherits from `obj1` but has no own properties, `assert.deepEqual(obj1, obj4)` will throw an AssertionError because `obj4` is treated as an empty object during the comparison, despite sharing the prototype.

**Answer:**  
In legacy assertion mode, `assert.deepEqual()` ignores the prototypes of the objects being compared and only checks their enumerable own properties.",1,"In legacy assertion mode, `assert.deepEqual()` ignores object prototypes and only compares the own properties of the objects. This means that if two objects have different prototypes but identical own properties, they are considered equal. Conversely, if one object has own properties not present in the other, the assertion fails, even if the missing properties are inherited via the prototype chain.

**Answer:**

In legacy assertion mode, `assert.deepEqual()` ignores object prototypes and compares only the own properties. Therefore, when comparing objects with different prototypes, it checks for equality based solely on their own properties, disregarding any inherited properties from the prototype chain.",1

Answer: The ERR_ASSERTION error code indicates that an assertion has failed in Node.js. It is thrown by the assert module when an assertion test does not pass, providing details about the failure.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to figure out what the ERR_ASSERTION error code indicates in Node.js's assert module. Let me start by recalling what I know about Node.js errors. I remember that Node.js has various error codes, each indicating a specific type of issue.

I think the assert module is used for testing invariants, and when an assertion fails, it throws an error. The question is about the ERR_ASSERTION code. I should look through the provided context to find relevant information.

Looking through the context, I see multiple mentions of AssertionError. It's a subclass of Error, and all errors thrown by the assert module are instances of this. The context mentions that when an assertion fails, it results in an AssertionError.

I also notice that the error has properties like code, which is set to 'ERR_ASSERTION'. For example, in one of the code snippets, there's an assertion that checks if err.code is 'ERR_ASSERTION'. This indicates that whenever an assertion fails, the error code is set to this specific value.

So, putting it together, the ERR_ASSERTION error code is used by the assert module to indicate that an assertion has failed. It's part of the AssertionError class, which provides details about the failure, including actual and expected values, the operator used, and whether the message was generated automatically.

I don't see any information in the context that suggests ERR_ASSERTION is used outside of the assert module or for different purposes. It's specifically tied to assertion failures.

Therefore, the answer should explain that ERR_ASSERTION is the error code for an AssertionError, which occurs when an assertion in Node.js's assert module fails, providing details about the failure.
</think>

The ERR_ASSERTION error code in Node.js's assert module indicates that an assertion has failed, resulting in an AssertionError. This error is thrown whenever an assertion test does not pass, providing details such as the actual and expected values, the operator used in the assertion, and whether the error message was auto-generated.

Content Retrieval,What is the purpose of the stackStartFn parameter in assert.fail() Node.js?,The stackStartFn parameter in assert.fail() allows you to omit stack frames above the specified function from the stack trace.,"The `stackStartFn` parameter in `assert.fail()` is used to truncate the exception's stack trace. It allows you to specify a function from which the stack trace should start, effectively excluding frames below it. This is particularly useful for hiding internal frames and making error messages more concise and relevant. 

For example, when `suppressFrame` is passed as the `stackStartFn`, the resulting error will not include the frames from `suppressFrame`, leading to a cleaner error output.

**Answer:**  
The `stackStartFn` parameter is used to truncate the exception's stack trace, starting it from the specified function to exclude certain frames and make the error message more concise.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the purpose of the `stackStartFn` parameter in `assert.fail()` in Node.js. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll start by looking at the context provided to understand what this parameter does.

First, I see that `assert.fail()` is a method that throws an `AssertionError`. The context mentions that `stackStartFn` is a parameter that, if provided, removes all stack frames above that function from the stack trace. It references `Error.captureStackTrace()`, which I know is a method used to capture the stack trace of an error.

Looking deeper, the context explains that when `stackStartFn` is provided, the generated stack trace will omit frames above this function. This is useful for truncating the exception's stack trace, making it cleaner by removing internal frames that might not be relevant to the user's code.

There's an example where `stackStartFn` is used in a function `suppressFrame()`, which calls `assert.fail()` with `suppressFrame` as the `stackStartFn`. This results in the stack trace not including the frames above `suppressFrame`, which probably makes debugging more focused on the user's code rather than internal Node.js or module functions.

I also notice that `stackStartFn` is a function type and has a default value, though the context doesn't specify what it defaults to. It's important because if not provided, the stack trace won't be altered.

So, putting it together, the purpose of `stackStartFn` is to control the stack trace of the thrown `AssertionError` by excluding frames above a specified function. This helps in providing a more relevant and less cluttered stack trace for debugging purposes.
</think>

The `stackStartFn` parameter in `assert.fail()` is used to truncate the stack trace of the thrown `AssertionError`. When provided, it removes all stack frames above the specified function, making the error more focused and relevant by excluding internal frames. This is achieved by capturing the stack trace using `Error.captureStackTrace()`, allowing for a cleaner debugging experience.

Content Retrieval,What happens if you pass a non-string value as the first argument to assert.match() in Node.js?,"If a non-string value is passed as the first argument to assert.match(), an AssertionError is thrown with the message: ""The 'string' argument must be of type string.""","If you pass a non-string value as the first argument to `assert.match()` in Node.js, it throws an `AssertionError` with the message: ""The 'string' argument must be of type string.""

**Answer:**  
Passing a non-string value as the first argument to `assert.match()` results in an `AssertionError` with the message: ""The 'string' argument must be of type string.""",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out what happens when you pass a non-string value as the first argument to assert.match() in Node.js. Let me look through the context provided.

I see that in the context, there are examples where assert.match() is called with different arguments. For instance, there's a line where assert.match(123, /pass/) is called, and it results in an AssertionError. The error message says, ""The 'string' argument must be of type string.""

So, when the first argument is not a string, like 123, which is a number, the function throws an AssertionError. The message specifically mentions that the string argument must be of type string. This indicates that the function expects the first argument to be a string and will throw an error if it's not.

I don't see any other behaviors mentioned, like converting the argument to a string or anything else. It seems straightforward: if the first argument isn't a string, it throws an error with that specific message.

So, the answer is that passing a non-string value as the first argument to assert.match() will cause an AssertionError to be thrown, stating that the string argument must be of type string.

Looking at the context, I see entries like [SPARK-44581] followed by a description. In this case, the description is: ""Fix the bug that ShutdownHookManager gets wrong UGI from SecurityManager of ApplicationMaster.""

So, the issue addressed by SPARK-44581 is fixing a bug where ShutdownHookManager was obtaining the wrong User Group Information (UGI) from the SecurityManager of the ApplicationMaster in Apache Spark.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what was fixed in Apache Spark issue SPARK-31967. I remember that the user provided a context with a bunch of JIRA links and some descriptions. Let me go through that context step by step.

First, I'll look through the context to see if SPARK-31967 is mentioned anywhere. I'll start by scanning the text for the exact term. The context includes a list of various SPARK issues, each with their own descriptions. I'll go through each one.

Looking at the context, I see issues like SPARK-51128, SPARK-51129, SPARK-51157, and so on. There's a section that talks about different built-in libraries and some trademark information, but that's probably not relevant here.

I'll check each issue one by one. SPARK-51128 is about self-hosting a CSS map file. SPARK-51129 is fixing code tab switching on the Spark website. SPARK-51157 adds a Scala annotation. These don't seem related to SPARK-31967.

Continuing down, I see issues like SPARK-51164 about fixing a test by enabling a configuration, and SPARK-51173 which is related to adding a Scalastyle rule. Still not seeing SPARK-31967.

There's a part that mentions dependency upgrades, like Jetty and ORC, but again, no SPARK-31967. Then I see some fixes related to internal errors, thread-safety issues, and query fixes in later issues. 

I'll keep going through each SPARK issue listed. There's SPARK-49804 about executor container exit codes, SPARK-49836 about window functions, SPARK-49843 about column comments, and SPARK-49959 about ColumnarArray.copy(). None of these match SPARK-31967.

Looking further, there are some Spark 3.4 specific fixes like performance regressions and Python datetime issues. But SPARK-31967 isn't there either.

I'm starting to think that maybe SPARK-31967 isn't mentioned in the provided context at all. All the issues listed are in the 45k, 48k, 49k, and 50k ranges, and some in the 51k range. The number 31967 is much lower, so perhaps it's from an older version or not included here.

I'll double-check to make sure I didn't miss it. Scanning through again, I don't see any mention of SPARK-31967. So, based on the context given, there's no information about what was fixed in that particular issue.

Alright, I need to figure out the change made to the modal and offcanvas header spacing in Bootstrap. Let me start by reading the user's question again to make sure I understand it correctly. The question is asking specifically about the changes made to the spacing in the headers of modals and offcanvas components.

Looking at the provided context, I see a list of various issues and their corresponding fixes. I'll go through each CSS-related change to find anything related to modals or offcanvas headers.

First, I come across issue #39373, which mentions ""refactor css: modal and offcanvas header spacing."" This seems directly relevant. The description says, ""Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers."" That suggests they removed a previous feature where items were evenly distributed in the headers.

I should make sure there are no other related changes. Scanning through, I don't see any other issues that mention modals or offcanvas headers. The other CSS changes are about accordions, form controls, radio-switches, and RTL processing, which don't pertain to header spacing.

So, the key change is that the evenly distributed layout in the headers was dropped. This means that the spacing is no longer automatically adjusted to spread out the items evenly. Instead, the headers might now use a different layout approach, but the context doesn't specify what replaced it, so I can only state what was removed.

Content Retrieval Complex,How does error handling differ between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js?,"Synchronous APIs handle errors using throw and try...catch, while asynchronous APIs report errors via Promises, callbacks, or 'error' events.","In Node.js, error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in the following way:

- **Synchronous APIs**: These methods, such as `fs.readFileSync`, throw errors using the `throw` statement. To handle errors, you must use a `try-catch` block around the synchronous call.

- **Asynchronous APIs**: These methods typically use an ""error-first callback"" pattern. A callback function is provided, and the error is passed as the first argument to this callback. If an error occurs, the callback is invoked with the error object; otherwise, the first argument is `null`.

Thus, synchronous errors are handled with `try-catch`, while asynchronous errors are handled within the callback by checking the first argument.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js based on the provided context. Let me start by reading the context carefully.

The context mentions that some asynchronous methods in Node.js may still use the `throw` mechanism, which requires handling with `try…catch`. It also notes that there's no comprehensive list of such methods, so checking each method's documentation is necessary.

Then, it talks about the `'error'` event mechanism being common for stream-based and event emitter-based APIs. These handle errors by emitting an 'error' event. If an 'error' event handler isn't provided, the error is thrown, leading to an uncaught error in the Node.js process.

So, for synchronous APIs, errors are typically handled using `try…catch` because they're executed in-line and any exceptions can be caught immediately. 

For asynchronous APIs, especially those using streams or event emitters, errors are usually handled by listening for the 'error' event. However, some async methods might still throw exceptions that need a `try…catch`. 

I should structure the answer by comparing the two approaches: synchronous using `try…catch` and asynchronous using event listeners, while noting that some async methods use `throw` as well.
</think>

In Node.js, error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs as follows:

- **Synchronous APIs**: Errors are typically handled using `try…catch` blocks. When a synchronous operation throws an error, it can be caught and managed within the same block of code.

- **Asynchronous APIs**: 
  - **Event-based (e.g., streams, event emitters)**: These often emit an 'error' event. Listeners can be attached to handle errors as they occur. If no listener is provided, the error may be thrown, leading to an uncaught exception.
  - **Callback-based or other async methods**: Some methods may use the `throw` mechanism, requiring `try…catch` or proper error handling in callbacks.

Thus, synchronous errors are handled inline, while asynchronous errors are usually managed through event listeners or callbacks, with some methods still requiring `try…catch`.",0,"In Node.js, error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs as follows:

1. **Synchronous APIs**: These functions, such as `fs.readFileSync`, block execution until they complete. Errors are thrown directly using `throw`, requiring the use of `try/catch` blocks for handling.

2. **Asynchronous APIs**: These functions typically use either callbacks or return promises. 
   - **Callbacks**: Follow the error-first pattern, where the callback function receives the error as the first argument. If no error occurs, this argument is `null`.

First, I see a section about error.code. It says that error.code is a string label identifying the error type and is the most stable way to identify an error. It only changes between major Node.js versions. That's a key point about its stability.

Then, looking at the error.message sections, it mentions that error.message is a string description set by the Error constructor. However, the context states that error.message strings may change between any versions of Node.js, including minor ones. This explains why it's less stable.

So, putting it together, error.code is more stable because it's less likely to change, whereas error.message can change more frequently, making it less reliable for long-term error handling.
</think>

The `error.code` property is more stable than `error.message` in Node.js because `error.code` only changes between major versions of Node.js, providing a consistent identifier for the type of error.

Content Retrieval Complex,What should be done in nodejs errors if an asynchronous method returns a Promise?,"If an asynchronous method returns a Promise, you should always handle the possibility that it might be rejected, for example, using .catch() or try...catch with await.","When an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a Promise, it's crucial to handle potential rejections properly. Here's how you can manage this:

1. **Using `.catch()`**: Attach a `.catch()` method to the Promise chain to handle any errors that occur during the asynchronous operation. This ensures that any rejections are caught and processed, preventing unhandled rejections.

2. **Using `try/catch` with Async/Await**: If you're using async/await syntax, wrap the Promise-based code in a `try` block and use a `catch` block to handle any errors. This approach makes the code look more synchronous and can improve readability.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage errors from Promises, ensuring your application remains stable and handles exceptions gracefully.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do when an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a Promise. I remember that Promises can either resolve or reject, and handling errors is crucial. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that when you use a Promise, you should handle both the success and error cases. In synchronous code, you use try/catch blocks to handle exceptions. I think in asynchronous code with Promises, you can use .catch() to handle rejections. But I've also heard about async/await making this easier.

Wait, in the context provided, there's a code example using async/await. It uses a try/catch block around an await statement. So, when you await a Promise, if it rejects, it throws an error that can be caught in the catch block. That makes sense because it's similar to synchronous error handling.

The context also mentions the --unhandled-rejections flag. I think this is related to how Node.js handles uncaught promise rejections. If a Promise is rejected and there's no .catch() or try/catch, Node.js might emit an unhandledRejection event. Using this flag can change how the process reacts, maybe by converting unhandled rejections into exceptions or changing the behavior in some way.

So, putting it together, the best practice is to always handle potential rejections. Using try/catch with async/await is a clean way to do this. Alternatively, you could chain a .catch() method to the Promise. Either way, you need to ensure that any errors are caught and handled appropriately to prevent the application from crashing or behaving unexpectedly.

I should also note that ignoring rejections can lead to silent failures, which are hard to debug. Therefore, it's important to have some form of error handling in place for every Promise returned by asynchronous methods.

Another thing to consider is logging or monitoring these rejections so that you're aware when something goes wrong. But the immediate step is to handle them in the code to maintain application stability.

In summary, when a Node.js asynchronous method returns a Promise, you should always handle the possibility of it being rejected. This can be done using try/catch blocks with async/await or by using the .catch() method on the Promise chain. Additionally, being aware of the --unhandled-rejections flag can help configure how the process behaves when rejections aren't handled.
</think>

When an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a Promise, it is essential to handle potential rejections to prevent unhandled exceptions. Here's how you should manage it:

1. **Use try/catch with async/await**: Wrap your await calls in a try block and handle errors in the corresponding catch block. This approach mirrors synchronous error handling and makes your code cleaner and easier to read.

2. **Chain .catch() for Promises**: If you prefer using the Promise chaining syntax, append a .catch() method to handle any errors that occur during the Promise resolution.

3. **Understand the --unhandled-rejections Flag**: Node.js provides the --unhandled-rejections flag to manage how the process reacts to unhandled Promise rejections. This can be useful for configuring behavior such as converting unhandled rejections into exceptions.

By implementing these strategies, you ensure that your application gracefully handles errors, preventing crashes and silent failures. Always handle rejections to maintain application stability and ease debugging.",1,"When an asynchronous method in Node.js returns a Promise, it's crucial to handle potential rejections properly to maintain application stability. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Handle Rejections with .catch()**: Use the `.catch()` method to handle cases where the Promise is rejected. This ensures that any errors are caught and managed appropriately.

2. **Use Async/Await with Try/Catch**: For cleaner code, utilize async functions with try/catch blocks. This allows you to handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors in a single place, improving readability.

3. **Prevent Unhandled Rejections**: Always ensure that Promises have proper error handling to avoid unhandled rejections, which can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

4. **Understand Node.js Configuration**: Be aware of the `--unhandled-rejections` flag, which controls how Node.js handles unhandled Promise rejections, helping you configure the application's error handling behavior.

Content Retrieval Complex,What happens if no 'error' event handler is provided for an EventEmitter in nodejs?,"If no 'error' event handler is provided for an EventEmitter, the error will cause the Node.js process to crash unless a handler for 'uncaughtException' is registered.","If no 'error' event handler is provided for an EventEmitter in Node.js, the error will be thrown, leading to an uncaught exception.

Note that using try…catch won't intercept these errors because they are emitted asynchronously after the calling code has completed.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what happens if there's no 'error' event handler provided for an EventEmitter in Node.js. I remember that EventEmitter is a core module in Node.js used for handling events. When an error occurs, it's common to emit an 'error' event. But what if the developer forgets to add a listener for that event?

I'll start by recalling the basic behavior of EventEmitter. Normally, when an event is emitted and there's no listener, nothing happens. But the 'error' event is special. I think if you emit an 'error' without a listener, it crashes the process. But why is that?

Looking at the context provided, it mentions that if no 'error' handler is provided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an uncaught exception and crash. So, the process doesn't just ignore the error; it actively throws it, leading to a crash. This makes sense because errors are critical and should be handled; otherwise, the application's state could become unpredictable.

The context also notes that this behavior can be mitigated in two ways: either by registering a handler for the 'uncaughtException' event or using the deprecated 'node:domain' module. So, developers have options to prevent the crash, but they must take explicit steps.

I should also consider the part about try…catch blocks. The context says that errors generated this way can't be caught by try…catch because they're thrown after the calling code has exited. That means traditional error handling won't work here, emphasizing the need for an 'error' event listener.

Putting it all together, the key points are:
1. No 'error' handler leads to the error being thrown.
2. This results in an uncaught exception.
3. The Node.js process crashes unless 'uncaughtException' is handled or domains are used.

I think I've covered the main aspects. Now, I'll structure this into a clear, step-by-step explanation for the answer.
</think>

If no 'error' event handler is provided for an `EventEmitter` in Node.js, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an uncaught exception and crash.

2. The deprecated `node:domain` module is used appropriately.

Content Retrieval Complex,"How does Node.js handle errors that occur within asynchronous APIs, and what mechanisms are available for error propagation?","Node.js handles errors in asynchronous APIs through several mechanisms: errors can be propagated via rejected Promises, callback functions (where the first argument is an Error object), or 'error' events on EventEmitter objects.

It's important to consult each method's documentation to determine the appropriate error handling approach.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to answer how Node.js handles errors in asynchronous APIs and what mechanisms are available for error propagation. Let me start by recalling what I know about Node.js error handling.

I remember that Node.js uses both synchronous and asynchronous error handling. For synchronous code, try/catch blocks work, but for async operations, especially callbacks, errors are passed as the first argument to the callback. But the question is about asynchronous APIs, so I should focus on that.

Looking at the context provided, it mentions that some asynchronous methods in Node.js may still use the throw mechanism. That means if an error occurs, it's thrown and must be caught with try…catch. But the context also says there's no comprehensive list, so developers need to check each method's documentation. That's an important point.

Then, the context talks about the 'error' event mechanism, which is common for stream-based and event emitter-based APIs. These are asynchronous and handle errors by emitting an 'error' event. So, for those types of APIs, instead of using callbacks or promises, you listen for the error event on the object.

Putting it together, Node.js handles async errors in a few ways. Some methods use throw, requiring try…catch. Others, especially streams and event emitters, emit 'error' events. Additionally, I remember that in promises, errors are caught with .catch(), and in async/await, try…catch wraps around the async function.

The context also mentions that all JavaScript errors are instances of the Error class, ensuring they have at least the standard properties. So, any error handling mechanism in Node.js will involve these Error instances.

So, the answer should cover:

1. The throw mechanism for certain async methods, needing try…catch.
2. The 'error' event for streams and event emitters.
3. The role of the Error class in all error handling.

I should structure this clearly, explaining each mechanism and how they're used in different APIs.
</think>

Node.js handles errors within asynchronous APIs through several mechanisms:

1. **Throw Mechanism**: Certain asynchronous methods in Node.js may use the `throw` mechanism to raise exceptions. These must be handled using `try…catch` blocks. Developers should refer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate error handling approach.

2. **'error' Event Mechanism**: This is commonly used for stream-based and event emitter-based APIs. These APIs emit an 'error' event when an error occurs, allowing developers to handle errors by listening to this event.

3. **Error Class**: All JavaScript errors in Node.js are instances of the standard JavaScript `Error` class, ensuring they provide at least the properties available on that class. This consistency helps in error handling across different APIs.

These mechanisms ensure that errors are properly propagated and handled, depending on the type of error and the style of the API being used.",0,"Node.js handles errors in asynchronous APIs through several mechanisms, each suited to different styles of asynchronous operations:

1. **Callbacks**: Asynchronous functions using callbacks typically pass errors as the first argument to the callback. It's essential to check for this error in the callback function.

3. **Async/await**: With async/await, errors can be caught using `try…catch` blocks, allowing for a more synchronous coding style.

4. **Exception Handling**: Some asynchronous methods in Node.js may throw exceptions that must be handled with `try…catch`. It's crucial to consult the documentation for each method to determine the appropriate error handling approach.

In summary, Node.js provides flexible error handling mechanisms, and the choice depends on the asynchronous approach used. Always refer to the specific method's documentation for guidance on handling errors effectively.",1

Okay, I need to figure out the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js and why it's preferred over error.message for identifying errors. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

First, I'll look up what error.code is. The context says that error.code is a string label that identifies the kind of error. It's the most stable way to identify an error because it only changes between major versions of Node.js. That makes sense because if something is stable, it's less likely to cause issues when updating Node.js versions.

Now, looking at error.message, it's described as a string description of the error. The context mentions that error.message can change between any versions of Node.js, not just major ones. This instability means that relying on error.message could lead to problems if the message changes in a minor update, which is more frequent and might not be as thoroughly tested.

The context also explains that error.message is set by the constructor when creating a new Error, like new Error(""message""). While this message is useful for humans, it's not reliable for programmatic checks because the exact wording might vary across versions. On the other hand, error.code is designed to be consistent, making it a better choice for identifying and handling specific errors programmatically.

I also notice that the context provides examples of error codes and their stability, which reinforces the idea that error.code is more reliable. The error.message, while informative, isn't as dependable for consistent error handling across different Node.js versions.

So, putting it all together, error.code is preferred because it's stable and consistent, whereas error.message can change frequently and isn't as reliable for identifying errors in a consistent manner.
</think>

The `error.code` property in Node.js is a string label that identifies the type of error. It is the most stable way to identify errors because it only changes between major versions of Node.js. This makes it more reliable for error identification.

Content Retrieval Complex,What is the difference between assert.deepEqual() and assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js?,"assert.deepEqual() uses the == operator for comparison, which allows coercion (e.g., 1 == '1'), while assert.deepStrictEqual() uses Object.is(), which performs strict equality checks (e.g., 1 !== '1'). assert.deepStrictEqual() is recommended for more reliable assertions.","The difference between `assert.deepEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in Node.js lies in their strictness and the aspects they consider during comparison:

1. **Type Coercion and Strictness**:
   - `assert.deepEqual()` performs a deep equality check but allows for some type coercion. For example, it may treat numeric strings as numbers, leading to unexpected results in certain cases.
   - `assert.deepStrictEqual()` is stricter and does not perform any type coercion, requiring both value and type to be identical.

2. **Handling of Symbols**:
   - `assert.deepStrictEqual()` considers symbols in objects. If two objects have different symbols as keys, even with the same description, it will throw an `AssertionError` because symbols are unique and not equal by reference.
   - `assert.deepEqual()` may not consider symbols in the same way, potentially ignoring them or treating them differently.

3. **Comparison Depth and Properties**:
   - Both functions perform a deep check of enumerable own properties, but `deepStrictEqual` is more thorough, ensuring all nested properties and types match exactly without any leniency.

In summary, `assert.deepStrictEqual()` is more stringent, ensuring exact matches in both value and type, including symbols, whereas `assert.deepEqual()` is more lenient, allowing some type conversions and potentially ignoring certain properties like symbols.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the difference between assert.deepEqual() and assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js. Let me start by recalling what I know about these functions.

I remember that both functions are used for deep equality checks, meaning they compare the contents of objects and arrays, not just references. But I think there's a key difference between them related to type coercion.

Looking at the context provided, I see mentions of assert.partialDeepStrictEqual and how it behaves, but that's not directly relevant. I need to focus on the two functions in question.

I recall that assert.deepEqual() allows for some type coercion. For example, if you compare a number and a string that can be converted to that number, deepEqual might consider them equal. On the other hand, deepStrictEqual is stricter and doesn't allow type coercion. So if the types are different, even if the values can be coerced, deepStrictEqual will fail.

In the context, there's a part that says assert.partialDeepStrictEqual does not require all properties in actual to be present in expected, but that's about partial vs full deep equality, not the strictness of type checking.

I also see that assert.deepStrictEqual() does not allow type coercion, which aligns with my initial thought. So the main difference is that deepStrictEqual enforces strict type checking, whereas deepEqual does not and may coerce types during comparison.

So, to sum up, the key difference is that assert.deepEqual() uses loose comparison with type coercion, while assert.deepStrictEqual() uses strict comparison without any coercion.
</think>

The main difference between `assert.deepEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in Node.js is their handling of type coercion during deep equality checks:

- **`assert.deepEqual()`** performs a deep comparison but allows for type coercion. This means that if two values can be coerced into the same type (e.g., the number `1` and the string `'1'`), it will consider them equal.

- **`assert.deepStrictEqual()`** performs a strict deep comparison without allowing any type coercion. It checks both the structure and the exact types of values, so `1` and `'1'` would be considered different.

In summary, `deepEqual` is more lenient with type differences, while `deepStrictEqual` enforces strict type equality.",1,"The key differences between `assert.deepEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in Node.js are as follows:

1. **Type Checking**:
   - `assert.deepEqual()` performs type coercion before comparing values, meaning it may consider different types as equal if their coerced values match.
   - `assert.deepStrictEqual()` does not coerce types and enforces strict type equality, meaning both the type and value must be identical.

2. **Symbol Handling**:
   - `assert.deepStrictEqual()` differentiates between objects using different Symbols, even if their descriptions are the same, treating them as unequal.
   - `assert.deepEqual()` may not handle Symbols as strictly, depending on the context.

3. **Object Comparison**:
   - Both functions perform deep comparisons of object properties and nested structures.
   - However, `assert.deepStrictEqual()` is stricter, ensuring that not only values but also references (for certain cases like Symbols) are identical.

In summary, `assert.deepStrictEqual()` is more stringent, enforcing exact type and reference equality, whereas `assert.deepEqual()` is more lenient with type coercion.",1
Content Retrieval Complex,How does assert.throws() validate errors in Node.js?,"assert.throws() allows you to specify an error validation mechanism, such as a Class, RegExp, validation function, or object. It checks that the function throws an error matching the specified criteria, throwing an AssertionError if the validation fails.",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how assert.throws() validates errors in Node.js. I remember that assert.throws() is a method used in testing to check if a function throws a specific error when it's supposed to. But I'm not exactly sure how it works under the hood.

Looking at the context provided, I see some code examples. The first example shows using assert.throws() with a function that throws an Error and a regular expression to match the error message. So, it seems like assert.throws() can take a function to execute and a pattern or object to validate against.

I also notice that there's a mention of custom error validation where a function must return true. This suggests that you can pass a custom validation function to assert.throws(), which allows for more complex checks beyond just the error type and message.

The context mentions that if the error is generated in a way that can't be intercepted by try…catch, like using process.emit(), then assert.throws() might not catch it because the error is thrown after the code has exited. That's an important limitation to remember.

There are examples using both callback and promise-based validations. It looks like assert.throws() can handle different types of validations, such as using a RegExp to check the error message or ensuring the error is an instance of a specific Error subclass.

I also see that if the message parameter is an instance of Error, it will be thrown instead of an AssertionError. This means you can pass an actual error object, and if the test fails, that error is used instead of a generic AssertionError.

In summary, assert.throws() works by executing a provided function, checking if it throws an error, and then validating that error against the expected criteria, which could be an error type, message, or a custom function. It's flexible but has some limitations with certain types of errors that can't be caught by try…catch.
</think>

assert.throws() validates errors in Node.js by executing a provided function and checking if it throws an error. It can validate against error types, messages using regular expressions, or custom validation functions.

Okay, I need to figure out the purpose of assert.CallTracker in Node.js and why it's deprecated. Let me start by looking through the provided context.

First, I see that the assert.CallTracker class was added in versions v14.2.0 and v12.19.0. It's marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future version, specifically mentioned in changes for v20.1.0. That's a clear sign that it's no longer recommended for use.

Looking deeper, the purpose of CallTracker is to track if functions were called a specific number of times. The example shows creating a tracker, wrapping a function, and then calling tracker.verify() to check if the function was called the expected number of times. This is usually done in a process.on('exit') handler, which makes sense because it ensures the verification happens when the process is exiting.

The context mentions that using tracker.verify() is necessary for the verification to take place. If the function wasn't called the required number of times, it throws an error. This was probably useful for testing or ensuring certain parts of the code were executed as expected.

Now, why is it deprecated? The context doesn't explicitly state the reason, but deprecations often happen when a feature is outdated or there's a better alternative. Since it's part of the assert module, maybe there's a more modern testing approach that Node.js is moving towards. The context also mentions that the feature was experimental, so perhaps it didn't gain enough traction or had issues that made it less favorable.

I should also consider if there are any alternatives suggested. The context doesn't provide specific alternatives, but in testing, mocks or other assertion libraries might be recommended instead.

So, putting it all together, assert.CallTracker was used to track function calls, ensuring they were called a certain number of times, and it's deprecated because it's being phased out, likely in favor of better testing practices or tools.

Content Retrieval Complex,How does assert.partialDeepStrictEqual() differ from assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js?,"assert.partialDeepStrictEqual() only compares properties that exist on the expected parameter, making it useful for partial comparisons. In contrast, assert.deepStrictEqual() requires all properties to match exactly, including those not present in the expected object.",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()` differs from `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in Node.js. I remember that both functions are used for deep equality checks, but I'm not exactly sure about the differences.

Let me start by recalling what `assert.deepStrictEqual()` does. From what I know, it checks if two values are deeply equal, meaning it compares all properties and values recursively. It doesn't allow type coercion, so if the types of the values are different, it will throw an error. Also, I think it requires that all properties in both the actual and expected objects must match exactly.

Now, about `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()`. The name suggests it's a partial check, which might mean it's more lenient in some way. Maybe it doesn't require all properties to be present in both objects. I think it might only check that the properties present in the expected object are present and equal in the actual object, but it doesn't care if the actual has extra properties.

Looking at the context provided, there are some code examples. For instance, `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, { a: 1, b: 2 })` returns OK. This implies that the actual object can have more properties than the expected, and it's still considered equal. In contrast, if I used `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in this case, it would throw an error because the actual has an extra property `c`.

Another example is when using Sets. Both functions can handle them, but the key difference is in how they handle the properties. The context mentions that `partialDeepStrictEqual` does not require all properties in the actual to be present in the expected, while `deepStrictEqual` does. So, the main difference is that `partialDeepStrictEqual` is a superset of `deepStrictEqual`, meaning it can handle cases where the actual has more properties than the expected, but still enforces that all properties in the expected are present and equal in the actual.

I also note that `partialDeepStrictEqual` was added in a later version, which makes sense as it's a more specialized function. The context says it's a superset, so it can handle all the same cases as `deepStrictEqual` plus additional cases where extra properties are allowed in the actual.

In summary, the key difference is that `partialDeepStrictEqual` allows the actual object to have extra properties not present in the expected, while `deepStrictEqual` requires both objects to have exactly the same properties and values.
</think>

`assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` are both used for deep equality checks in Node.js, but they differ in how they handle the properties of the objects being compared:

1. **Strict Requirement of Properties**:
   - `assert.deepStrictEqual()` requires that both the actual and expected objects have exactly the same properties. If the actual object has extra properties not present in the expected, it will throw an `AssertionError`.
   - `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()` does not require all properties in the actual to be present in the expected. It only checks that the properties in the expected are present and equal in the actual, allowing the actual to have additional properties.

2. **Superset Relationship**:
   - `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()` behaves as a superset of `assert.deepStrictEqual()`, meaning it can handle all cases that `deepStrictEqual` can, plus additional cases where the actual object has more properties than the expected.

3. **Version Addition**:
   - `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()` was introduced in a later version (v22.13.0) compared to `assert.deepStrictEqual()`.

In summary, the main difference is that `partialDeepStrictEqual` is more flexible, allowing extra properties in the actual object, while `deepStrictEqual` enforces strict equality in all properties.",1,"assert.partialDeepStrictEqual() and assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js both perform deep comparisons of objects but have distinct behaviors:

1. **Purpose and Flexibility**:
   - **assert.partialDeepStrictEqual()**: Designed for flexible comparisons, allowing partial matching. It is useful when only specific parts of an object need to be checked, ignoring other properties or structures.
   - **assert.deepStrictEqual()**: Enforces a strict, exact match, requiring identical structure, type, and properties.

2. **Type Checking**:
   - **partialDeepStrictEqual**: May be more lenient with type conversions, potentially treating 2 and '2' as equal.
   - **deepStrictEqual**: Strictly enforces type equality, failing if types differ.

3. **Property and Structure Considerations**:
   - **partialDeepStrictEqual**: Can ignore certain properties or structures, such as symbols or functions, and may not require all keys to be present.
   - **deepStrictEqual**: Requires all properties, including symbols, to match exactly and in the same structure.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Use **partialDeepStrictEqual** for testing specific parts of objects without strict requirements on all aspects.
   - Use **deepStrictEqual** when exact data integrity and structure are critical.

In summary, partialDeepStrictEqual offers flexibility for partial matches, while deepStrictEqual ensures a precise and complete equality check.",0

Okay, I need to figure out what happens when someone calls assert.ok() without any arguments in Node.js. I remember that assert.ok() is a function used for testing if a value is truthy. But what if no arguments are provided?

Looking at the context provided, there's a lot of information about the assert module, specifically about assert.ok(). The context mentions that if no arguments are passed to assert.ok(), it throws an AssertionError with a specific message.

I see that in the examples, when assert.ok() is called without any arguments, it results in an AssertionError with the message ""No value argument passed to `assert.ok()`"". This happens because the function expects at least one argument, the value to test. Without it, the function can't evaluate anything and thus throws an error.

The context also explains that in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), the error message might be different compared to when it's run in a file, but the core behavior remains the same—throwing an AssertionError when no value is provided.

So, putting it all together, when assert.ok() is called without any arguments, Node.js throws an AssertionError indicating that no value was provided to the function.

Content Retrieval Complex,How does the assert.deepStrictEqual() method handle comparisons of WeakMap and WeakSet objects in Node.js?,"The assert.deepStrictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of WeakMap and WeakSet objects by checking their structure rather than their contents. Since WeakMap and WeakSet do not rely on their values for comparison, the method only verifies that the objects are instances of WeakMap or WeakSet and do not compare their internal entries.","The `assert.deepStrictEqual()` method in Node.js does not compare the entries of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` objects. Instead, it only verifies that both objects are instances of the same type, either `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`. This is because the entries within these structures cannot be reliably accessed or compared due to their weak referencing nature. As a result, the method does not perform a deep comparison of their contents and treats instances of the same type as equal regardless of their internal data.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the assert.deepStrictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of WeakMap and WeakSet objects. I remember that WeakMap and WeakSet are special because they hold weak references, but I'm not sure how that affects comparisons.

Looking at the context provided, I see that when comparing WeakMap instances, if they are different instances, even with the same contents, the comparison fails. The same goes for WeakSet. For example, comparing weakSet1 and weakSet2, which have the same object added, results in an AssertionError because they are different instances.

However, if you compare the same instance to itself, like weakSet1 to weakSet1, the assertion passes. This suggests that deepStrictEqual checks for reference equality when it comes to WeakMap and WeakSet.

The context also mentions that the comparison doesn't rely on their values. So even if two WeakMaps or WeakSets have the same keys or elements, if they're different instances, the assertion fails. This is different from regular Maps or Sets, where the contents are compared.

Additionally, the context notes that for WeakMap and WeakSet, the comparison doesn't depend on their values. This means that the method doesn't look into the actual data stored; it just checks if they're the same object in memory.

So, putting it all together, assert.deepStrictEqual() handles WeakMap and WeakSet by checking if they are the exact same instance. If they are different instances, even with identical contents, the assertion fails. It doesn't compare the contents inside these structures because of their weak reference nature and the way they're designed.
</think>

The `assert.deepStrictEqual()` method in Node.js handles comparisons of `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` objects by checking if they are the same instance in memory. It does not compare their contents. 

- Comparing different instances of `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`, even if they contain the same data, results in an `AssertionError` because they are not reference-equal.
- Comparing the same instance to itself succeeds as they are reference-equal.

In summary, `assert.deepStrictEqual()` treats `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` objects as reference-equal only if they are the exact same instance, without considering their contents.",0,"The `assert.deepStrictEqual()` method in Node.js does not perform a deep comparison of the contents within `WeakMap` or `WeakSet` objects.

The method does not attempt to compare the internal entries of these objects due to their nature of holding weak references, which are not enumerable and can change unpredictably. Therefore, it effectively performs a reference check without validating the contents of the `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`.

For example, when `stackStartFn` is provided, the stack trace begins at that function, omitting higher frames and focusing on the relevant part of the error. This is particularly useful for hiding internal frames and presenting a cleaner error output.",1,"<think>
Okay, I need to answer the question about the purpose of the stackStartFn parameter in the assert.fail() method and how it affects the error message. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The user is asking about the stackStartFn parameter in assert.fail(). I remember that in Node.js, the assert module has various methods for testing conditions, and assert.fail() is one of them. The question is specifically about this parameter and its effect on the error message.

Looking at the provided context, I see that the stackStartFn is a parameter in the assert.fail() method. The context mentions that if stackStartFn is provided, all stack frames above that function will be removed from the stacktrace. This is done using Error.captureStackTrace(). So, the purpose of stackStartFn is to modify the stack trace by truncating it.

Now, how does this affect the error message? The error message itself, which is the message property of the AssertionError, isn't directly altered by stackStartFn. Instead, the stack trace (the part that shows where the error was thrown) is modified. So, when an AssertionError is thrown, its stack property will not include frames above the function provided as stackStartFn. This makes the error message cleaner by hiding internal frames, but the actual message (like 'a' != 'b') remains the same.

I should also consider examples. In the context, there's an example where suppressFrame() calls assert.fail() with suppressFrame as the stackStartFn. The resulting stack trace only shows up to that function, making the error more concise.

So, the answer should explain that stackStartFn is used to truncate the stack trace by removing frames above the specified function, which helps in making the error messages more relevant by excluding internal calls. However, it doesn't change the error message content itself, just how the stack trace is displayed.
</think>

The `stackStartFn` parameter in the `assert.fail()` method is used to truncate the stack trace of the resulting `AssertionError`. When provided, all stack frames above the function specified by `stackStartFn` are removed.

**Answer:**

Content Retrieval Complex,Why is it recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode?,"It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because strict mode provides more reliable and precise comparisons.

Alright, so the user is asking why it's recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of the legacy one. I need to answer based on the provided context without adding any outside information.

First, I'll look through the context to find the differences between strict and legacy modes. I see that the legacy assertion mode has been deprecated and changed to legacy status in version v14.0.0. That's a strong indicator that it's no longer the preferred choice.

The context mentions that in legacy mode, NaN is treated as identical if both sides are NaN, which might lead to some unexpected results. This could be a point of confusion for developers.

I also notice that the legacy assertion mode uses methods like assert.equal(), which might not be as precise as the strict methods. The strict mode is an alias for assert.strictEqual(), which likely performs stricter comparisons, avoiding type coercion issues that can arise with the legacy methods.

Additionally, the context states that the legacy mode is marked as having stability level 3, which is Legacy, whereas the assert module itself is stable. This suggests that using legacy mode could lead to compatibility issues in the future or missing out on updates and improvements.

There's a recommendation to use assert.strictEqual() instead of the legacy mode, which implies that the strict mode is better maintained and supported. Furthermore, strict mode has been updated in various versions, such as v15.0.0, where it was exposed as require('node:assert/strict'), making it more accessible and standardized.

Overall, the reasons to prefer strict assertion mode are its stability, better comparison semantics, and alignment with current Node.js practices, while the legacy mode is deprecated and could cause unexpected behavior, especially with NaN values.
</think>

It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because:

1. **Deprecation and Legacy Status**: Legacy assertion mode has been deprecated and changed to ""Legacy"" status in version v14.0.0. This indicates that it is no longer recommended for use in new code.

2. **NaN Treatment**: In legacy assertion mode, NaN is treated as identical if both sides are NaN. This can lead to surprising results and is generally not the desired behavior in most cases.

3. **Stability**: The `assert` module itself has a stability rating of ""Stable,"" while legacy assertion mode has a stability level of 3 - Legacy.

4. **Recommendation to Use Modern Methods**: The documentation explicitly suggests using `assert.strictEqual()` instead of legacy assertion mode. Strict assertion mode is an alias of `assert.strictEqual()`, which provides more precise comparisons and avoids the pitfalls of the legacy mode.

5. **Clarity and Avoidance of Confusion**: Using strict assertion mode avoids confusion with the more usual meaning of ""strict mode"" in Node.js.

In summary, strict assertion mode is more modern, stable, and aligns with current Node.js practices, while legacy assertion mode is deprecated and may lead to unexpected behavior.",0,"It is recommended to use strict assertion mode in Node.js instead of legacy assertion mode because:

1. **Avoids Unexpected Results**: Legacy mode uses the Abstract Equality Comparison, which can lead to surprising outcomes, especially with functions like `assert.deepEqual()`. For example, comparing different types (like a RegExp and a Date) might not throw an error as expected.

2. **Stricter Comparisons**: Strict mode enforces stricter checks, ensuring that both value and type are considered, leading to more accurate and reliable test results.

3. **Deprecation Notice**: Legacy mode is deprecated, and using strict mode aligns with recommended practices, avoiding potential issues with outdated methods.

Example of unexpected behavior in legacy mode:
```javascript
assert.deepEqual(/a/gi, new Date()); // Does not throw an error
```

In strict mode, such comparisons correctly throw an `AssertionError`, providing clearer test outcomes.",1
Content Retrieval Complex,"What is the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors, and how is it used in assertions?","The error.code property in Node.js errors is a string label that identifies the type of error.

In the context of assertions, when an assertion fails, it throws an `AssertionError`. By checking the `error.code` property of this error, developers can determine the specific reason for the assertion failure, such as 'ERR_ASSERTION' for a failed `assert.ok()` check. This allows for more precise error handling and debugging.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the purpose of the error.code property in Node.js errors and how it's used in assertions. Let me start by looking through the context provided.

First, I see that the error.code property is a string label that identifies the kind of error. It's mentioned that error.code is the most stable way to identify an error because it only changes between major Node.js versions, unlike error.message which can change more frequently. This makes sense because relying on error messages for identification can be risky if they change, but error codes are more consistent.

Looking further, I see that in the context of assertions, when an AssertionError occurs, the error object has properties like actual, expected, operator, and code. For example, in the code snippets provided, after an assertion failure, there are checks like assert.strictEqual(err.code, 'ERR_ASSERTION'). This indicates that the error.code is used to specifically identify the type of error, in this case, an AssertionError.

So, the purpose of error.code is to provide a consistent identifier for the error type. In assertions, when testing, you can check the error.code to ensure that the correct type of error was thrown. This is useful because it allows for more reliable error handling and testing since it's not dependent on the error message's wording, which might vary.

I also notice that the error.code for an AssertionError is 'ERR_ASSERTION'. This is a specific code that Node.js assigns to assertion errors, making it easy to identify them programmatically. By checking error.code, developers can determine the nature of the error without parsing the error message, which can be more error-prone.

In summary, the error.code property serves as a stable identifier for errors, and in assertions, it's used to verify that the correct type of error was thrown, enhancing the reliability of tests and error handling.
</think>

The `error.code` property in Node.js is a string label that identifies the type of error. It is the most stable way to identify an error as it only changes between major versions of Node.js, unlike `error.message`, which can vary more frequently. 

In the context of assertions, when an `AssertionError` occurs, the error object includes properties such as `actual`, `expected`, `operator`, and `code`. The `error.code` property is used to specifically identify the type of error. For example, in an `AssertionError`, the `error.code` is set to `'ERR_ASSERTION'`. This allows for reliable identification of the error type in tests and error handling by checking the `error.code` property. 

Thus, the purpose of `error.code` is to provide a consistent identifier for errors, and in assertions, it is used to verify that the correct type of error was thrown, enhancing the reliability of tests and error handling.",1,"The `error.code` property in Node.js serves as a stable string identifier for the type of error encountered.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the `assert.rejects()` function in Node.js handles cases where an async function throws an error synchronously. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I know that `assert.rejects()` is used to test if an async function rejects a promise. But what happens if the async function doesn't return a promise? Or if it throws an error right away, not in the promise?

Looking at the context provided, I see that if the async function throws an error synchronously, `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected promise with that error. So, the error is caught and the promise is rejected immediately. Also, if the function doesn't return a promise at all, `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected promise with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error. In both cases, the error handler is skipped, which means any try-catch blocks or .catch() in the code won't handle this error because it's already being handled by the assertion.

I also notice that `assert.rejects()` behaves similarly to `assert.throws()`, except for the async nature. This makes sense because both are checking for errors, just in different contexts—synchronous vs. asynchronous.

So, putting it all together, if the async function throws an error synchronously, `assert.rejects()` wraps that error in a rejected promise. If the function doesn't return a promise, it returns a rejected promise with a specific error. The error handler isn't used in either case, which is important for testing because it ensures the error is properly propagated up.

Okay, so I need to figure out the difference between assert.doesNotThrow() and assert.doesNotReject() in Node.js. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see that both functions are part of the assert module in Node.js. The context mentions that assert.doesNotThrow() is for synchronous functions, while assert.doesNotReject() is for asynchronous functions. That seems like a key difference.

Looking at the parameters, both functions can take an error type and a message. So, they both can check if a specific error is thrown or rejected. But the main difference is in their application: one for sync, one for async.

I also notice that assert.doesNotReject() returns a promise. That makes sense because it's dealing with asynchronous operations. If the async function doesn't reject, the promise resolves. But if it does reject with an unexpected error, the promise rejects with an AssertionError.

On the other hand, assert.doesNotThrow() is used with synchronous functions. It doesn't return a promise because it doesn't need to wait for anything. If the function doesn't throw an error, it just completes. If it throws an error that doesn't match the expected type, it throws an AssertionError.

The context also mentions that assert.doesNotReject() isn't very useful because it just rejects the promise again, which might not add much value. It suggests adding comments instead for better error messages.

So, putting it all together, the main differences are their use cases (sync vs async), the handling of promises, and their behavior when errors occur. They both assert that certain errors shouldn't happen but in different execution contexts.

The difference between `assert.doesNotThrow()` and `assert.doesNotReject()` in Node.js lies in their application and behavior:

1. **Purpose**:
   - `assert.doesNotThrow()` is used for synchronous functions to assert that they do not throw an error.
   - `assert.doesNotReject()` is used for asynchronous functions, specifically promises, to assert that they do not reject.

2. **Parameters**:
   - Both functions can take an `error` parameter to check for a specific error type and an optional `message` for custom error messages.

3. **Behavior**:
   - `assert.doesNotThrow()` executes the provided function and asserts it doesn't throw an error. If it does throw an error of an unexpected type, an `AssertionError` is thrown.
   - `assert.doesNotReject()` returns a promise that resolves if the provided promise does not reject. If the promise rejects with an unexpected error, the returned promise rejects with an `AssertionError`.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Use `assert.doesNotThrow()` with synchronous code.
   - Use `assert.doesNotReject()` with asynchronous promises.

- **`assert.doesNotReject()`** is tailored for asynchronous code, particularly for promises. It checks whether a promise does not reject when awaited, making it ideal for verifying the successful resolution of asynchronous operations.

Content Retrieval Complex,How does the assert.strictEqual() method in Node.js handle comparisons of NaN values?,"The assert.strictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of NaN values by using the SameValue Comparison (Object.is()). Since NaN is considered identical to itself (NaN !== NaN is false), the method treats NaN values as equal when compared with each other.",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out how the assert.strictEqual() method in Node.js handles comparisons of NaN values. Let me start by recalling what I know about assert.strictEqual(). 

I remember that assert.strictEqual() is a method in Node.js's assert module used for strict equality checks. It uses the === operator, which checks both value and type. So, for example, 1 === 1 is true, but 1 === '1' is false because one is a number and the other is a string.

Now, NaN is a special case in JavaScript. I remember that NaN is not equal to itself. So, if I try NaN === NaN, it returns false. This is because, according to the IEEE 754 standard, NaNs are not considered equal to each other. This can be problematic because sometimes you do want to check if a value is NaN.

Looking at the context provided, I see several mentions of how assert methods handle NaN. For instance, in the assert.equal() method, there's a note that NaN is treated as identical if both sides are NaN. This is because assert.equal() uses the == operator, which does type coercion, but for NaN, it's specially handled.

However, assert.strictEqual() uses the === operator. Normally, NaN === NaN is false, but I'm curious if the assert module has any special handling for this. 

In the provided context, I see that the assert module's documentation mentions that in both strict and legacy modes, NaN is treated as identical if both sides are NaN. This suggests that even though the === operator would usually return false for NaN === NaN, the assert.strictEqual() method is designed to return true when both values are NaN.

So, when using assert.strictEqual(NaN, NaN), it should not throw an AssertionError. Instead, it will pass the assertion because the method is handling NaNs specially.

I also see that the context includes examples where assert.equal(NaN, NaN) works, but that's because assert.equal uses the == operator. However, the key point is that for strict equality in assert.strictEqual(), the method is explicitly handling NaN cases to consider them equal when both are NaN.

Therefore, the conclusion is that assert.strictEqual() treats NaN as identical if both sides are NaN, even though the === operator would normally return false.
</think>

The `assert.strictEqual()` method in Node.js treats `NaN` as identical if both sides of the comparison are `NaN`. This special handling means that when you use `assert.strictEqual(NaN, NaN)`, the assertion will pass without throwing an `AssertionError`, even though the strict equality operator `===` would normally return `false` for `NaN === NaN`. 

This behavior is explicitly designed to handle `NaN` values correctly within the assert module.",1,"The `assert.strictEqual()` method in Node.js does not consider `NaN` values as equal when compared using strict equality. This is because, in JavaScript, `NaN` is not equal to itself when using the `===` operator. Therefore, `assert.strictEqual(NaN, NaN)` will throw an error, as it returns `false`.

However, if you need to assert that two `NaN` values are considered equal, you should use `assert.deepStrictEqual()`, which uses the `Object.is()` comparison under the hood. The `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` method returns `true`, making `assert.deepStrictEqual(NaN, NaN)` pass without errors.

In summary:
- `assert.strictEqual(NaN, NaN)` will **fail** because `NaN !== NaN`.
- `assert.deepStrictEqual(NaN, NaN)` will **pass** because `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is `true`.

Use `assert.deepStrictEqual()` when you need to correctly handle `NaN` comparisons in your assertions.",0

Okay, so I need to figure out the purpose of the generatedMessage property in the assert.AssertionError class and determine when it's set to true. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll start by going through the provided context to understand what's going on.

First, I remember that in Node.js, the assert module is used for writing unit tests. When an assertion fails, it throws an AssertionError. I've seen this happen when using methods like assert.strictEqual or assert.equal.

Looking at the context, I see that the AssertionError class has several properties. One of them is generatedMessage, which is a boolean. The context mentions that generatedMessage indicates whether the message was auto-generated (true) or not. So, the purpose of generatedMessage is to tell if the error message was created automatically by the assert module or if it was provided manually.

Now, I need to find out when it's set to true. From the context, I see that when you create an AssertionError without providing a message, the assert module automatically generates one. For example, in the code snippet:

const { message } = new assert.AssertionError({
  actual: 1,
  expected: 2,
  operator: 'strictEqual'
});

Here, the message is generated by the AssertionError, so generatedMessage would be true.

On the other hand, if you provide a custom message, like in assert.fail('boom'), the generatedMessage would be false because the message isn't auto-generated.

I also notice that when using methods like assert.strictEqual(1, 2), the error message is generated automatically, which means generatedMessage is true. But if you use assert.fail with a custom message, it's set to false.

So, putting it all together, the generatedMessage property is used to check if the message was created by the AssertionError or provided by the user. It's set to true whenever the message is auto-generated by the assert module, such as when using assert methods without a custom message.
</think>

The `generatedMessage` property in the `assert.AssertionError` class is a boolean that indicates whether the error message was automatically generated by the assertion module (`true`) or if a custom message was provided (`false`). It is set to `true` when the error message is created by the assertion methods, such as `assert.strictEqual()`, without a user-provided message.",1,"The `generatedMessage` property in the `assert.AssertionError` class is a boolean that indicates whether the error message was automatically generated.

Okay, I need to figure out what type of release Apache Spark 2.4.7 is. Let me start by looking through the provided context to find any mentions of Spark 2.4.7.

I see a section labeled ""Spark Release 2.4.7"". It says that Spark 2.4.7 is a maintenance release containing stability, correctness, and security fixes. It's based on the branch-2.4 maintenance branch. The context also mentions that it's recommended for all 2.4 users to upgrade to this stable release.

So, putting this together, Spark 2.4.7 is specifically a maintenance release. It's focused on fixing issues and improving stability rather than introducing new features. Maintenance releases are typically meant to ensure the software remains reliable and secure without adding major functionalities, which aligns with what's described here.

Version-Specific Content Retrieval,What is the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 23.11.0?,"In Node.js v23.11.0, the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method is 1_2 - Release candidate.",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 23.11.0. I'm not entirely sure what ""stability level"" means, but I think it refers to how stable or reliable the method is in that version. I remember that Node.js modules often have stability ratings, like Stable, Experimental, or Deprecated.

Looking at the context provided, I see that it's a detailed documentation about the Node.js assert module. There are multiple versions mentioned, like 23.11.0, 21.7.3, 18.20.8, etc. Each version section starts with a stability rating. For example, under version 23.11.0, it says ""Stability: 2 - Stable."" That probably means the module itself is stable.

Now, I need to find information about the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method specifically. Scanning through the context, I see several examples and descriptions of this method. It's used for partial deep strict equality checks. However, I don't immediately see a section that explicitly states the stability level of this specific method in version 23.11.0.

Wait, maybe the stability of the method is the same as the module's stability. Since the module as a whole is marked as Stable in version 23.11.0, perhaps all its methods, including assert.partialDeepStrictEqual, are considered stable. I don't see any indication that this particular method is experimental or deprecated in this version.

So, putting it together, the stability level of assert.partialDeepStrictEqual in Node.js version 23.11.0 is likely the same as the module's stability, which is Stable, with a rating of 2.

Okay, so I need to figure out the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 22.14.0. Hmm, I remember that the context provided includes various versions and their stability information. Let me look through the context to find any mentions of assert.partialDeepStrictEqual.

I see that the context includes multiple versions like 22.14.0, 21.7.3, 20.19.0, etc. Each version has a section that starts with ""Stability: X - ..."" where X is a number. I need to find the section for version 22.14.0 and see what the stability level is for assert.partialDeepStrictEqual there.

Looking through the context, I spot a section labeled ""Version 22.14.0"". Under that, it says ""Stability: 2 - Stable"". That seems to be the general stability for the node:assert module. But I'm specifically looking for assert.partialDeepStrictEqual. 

Wait, in the context, there's a part that mentions the stability of assert.partialDeepStrictEqual. It says, ""The stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 22.14.0 is 1.0 - Experimental."" So that must be the answer.

I think that's it. So the stability level is 1.0 - Experimental.

Version-Specific Content Retrieval,What is the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 21.7.3?,No information available.,The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out the stability level of the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method in Node.js version 21.7.3. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The user wants to know the stability level of a specific method in a particular version of Node.js.

First, I recall that Node.js modules often have stability ratings. These ratings indicate how stable an API is—whether it's experimental, stable, deprecated, etc. The stability levels are usually denoted with a number, like 0 for deprecated, 1 for experimental, 2 for stable, etc.

Looking at the provided context, I see multiple sections that mention different versions of Node.js, such as 21.7.3, 20.19.0, 18.20.8, and others. Each of these sections starts with a header that includes the version number and a stability rating. For example, under version 21.7.3, it says ""> Stability: 2 - Stable"". This suggests that the overall module (node:assert) has a stability rating of 2, which is stable.

Now, the question is specifically about the assert.partialDeepStrictEqual method. I need to check if this method's stability is explicitly mentioned or if it inherits the module's stability. In the context provided, each version section lists the stability of the module, not individual methods. However, the method descriptions don't mention any exceptions or different stability levels for specific functions within the module.

Since the assert module as a whole is marked as stable (Stability: 2) in version 21.7.3, it's reasonable to conclude that all methods within this module, including assert.partialDeepStrictEqual, share the same stability rating unless stated otherwise. There's no indication in the context that any method within the assert module has a different stability level.

Therefore, the stability level of assert.partialDeepStrictEqual in Node.js version 21.7.3 is the same as the module's stability, which is 2 - Stable.

Okay, so I need to figure out what the CallTracker object can be used for in Node.js Assert version 14.21.3. I remember that the user provided a context, so I should focus on that. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

The context mentions that the CallTracker is part of the assert module. It says it's used to track if functions were called a specific number of times. That makes sense; it's probably used for testing to ensure certain functions are called as expected.

I see that the CallTracker is created using new assert.CallTracker(). Then, there's a method called tracker.verify() that must be called for verification. So the process is: create the tracker, use it to monitor function calls, and then call verify to check if the expected number of calls were made.

The context also notes that this feature is deprecated and suggests using alternatives like the mock helper function. But since the question is about version 14.21.3, I should explain its usage as per that version.

Looking deeper, the context provides some example code snippets, but they're a bit fragmented. However, the key points are there: the CallTracker is for tracking function calls, and verify() is necessary to validate the number of calls.

I should structure the answer to clearly state the purpose of CallTracker, how it's created, and the importance of the verify method. Also, mentioning that it's deprecated and suggesting alternatives might be helpful, but the main focus should be on its usage in the specified version.

So, putting it all together, the answer should explain that CallTracker is used to track function calls, created via new assert.CallTracker(), and requires tracker.verify() for validation. It's currently deprecated, so users should consider alternatives for future code.
</think>

The `CallTracker` object in Node.js Assert version 14.21.3 is used to track if functions were called a specific number of times.

Here's how it can be utilized:

1. **Create a CallTracker Instance**: Instantiate `CallTracker` using `new assert.CallTracker()`.

2. **Wrap Functions with Expected Calls**: Use `tracker.calls(func, exact)` to wrap a function and specify the exact number of times it should be called.

3. **Verify Calls**: Invoke `tracker.verify()` to check if all wrapped functions were called the expected number of times. This is typically done in a `process.on('exit')` handler.

4. **Debugging with Report**: The `tracker.report()` method provides detailed information about each function's call count, helpful for debugging when expectations aren't met.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');

const tracker = new assert.CallTracker();

function func() {}

const callsfunc = tracker.calls(func, 1);

callsfunc();

process.on('exit', () => {
  tracker.verify();
});
```

This setup ensures `func` is called exactly once, with verification occurring on process exit. The `CallTracker` is particularly useful for testing scenarios where function call validation is crucial. Note that as of version 14.21.3, `CallTracker` is experimental and may undergo changes.",1

Okay, so I need to figure out what the CallTracker object can be used for in Node.js Assert version 13.14.0. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

The context mentions that the CallTracker is part of the assert module. It says that it's used to track if functions were called a specific number of times. That makes sense because when writing tests, you often want to ensure that certain functions are called as expected.

I see that the CallTracker is created using new assert.CallTracker(). So the first thing I should note is how to instantiate it. Then, it says that tracker.verify() must be called for verification. That means after setting up the tracker, you have to call verify to check if the functions were called as expected.

Looking further, the context warns that this feature is deprecated and suggests using alternatives like the mock helper function. So, I should mention that it's deprecated and recommend considering alternatives.

The examples in the context show that the tracker is used to monitor function calls, and if the expected number of calls isn't met, it throws an AssertionError with specific properties like message, code, etc. This indicates that CallTracker is useful for assertions in tests to validate function invocation counts.

I also notice that the stability of CallTracker is marked as Experimental, so it's subject to changes. Therefore, it's important to note that while it's available, it might not be the best long-term solution.

Putting it all together, the CallTracker in Node.js Assert version 13.14.0 is a tool for tracking function calls during tests. It allows developers to verify that certain functions are called a specific number of times, which is crucial for ensuring the correctness of code behavior. However, since it's deprecated, users should consider moving to alternative methods in the future.

This indicates that the feature is still experimental and may be subject to changes.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the stability level of assert.CallTracker in Node.js version 19.9.0. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

First, I see that the context includes multiple entries about the assert.CallTracker class. The first mention says that the class was added in versions v12.19.0 and v14.2.0. It also states that the stability level is 1 - Experimental, meaning it's currently experimental and might change.

However, further down in the context, there's a change noted in version v20.1.0 where the assert.CallTracker class has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This change is marked under the stability level 0 - Deprecated.

But wait, the question is about version 19.9.0, which is before v20.1.0. So, I need to check if the deprecation applies to 19.9.0 or if it's still experimental there. 

Looking back, the initial entries about v12.19.0 and v14.2.0 have the stability as Experimental. Then, the deprecation is specifically mentioned starting from v20.1.0. Since 19.9.0 is earlier than 20.1.0, the deprecation hasn't happened yet in that version.

Therefore, in Node.js version 19.9.0, the stability level of assert.CallTracker should still be Experimental, not yet Deprecated.

Okay, so the user is asking about the stability level of `assert.CallTracker` in Node.js version 20.19.0. I need to find the correct information from the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I see several mentions of `assert.CallTracker` with different stability levels. In some parts, it's marked as ""Stability: 1 - Experimental"" and in others as ""Stability: 0 - Deprecated"". I need to figure out which one applies to version 20.19.0.

Looking at the context, there are entries about `assert.CallTracker` being added in versions v12.19.0 and v14.2.0. Then, under changes, it mentions that in version v20.1.0, the `assert.CallTracker` class was deprecated and will be removed in the future. This change is noted multiple times in the context.

Since the user is asking about version 20.19.0, which is after v20.1.0, it means that by 20.19.0, the deprecation has already been noted. Therefore, the stability level should be 0 - Deprecated.

I should make sure there's no conflicting information. All mentions of v20.1.0 and beyond for `assert.CallTracker` point to it being deprecated. So, the answer should reflect that the stability level is Deprecated.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the CERT_NOT_YET_VALID error is in Node.js version 22.14.0 and when it occurs. I'm looking at the provided context, which is a detailed document about various errors in Node.js. 

First, I'll scan through the context to see if there's any mention of CERT_NOT_YET_VALID. I see sections about ERR_UNKNOWN_CREDENTIAL, ERR_UNKNOWN_ENCODING, ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION, and others. There's also a section on ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID and ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE. 

Wait, I don't see CERT_NOT_YET_VALID listed anywhere here. The context talks about different error categories like standard JavaScript errors, system errors, and user-specified errors. It also goes into specifics about TLS-related errors, but nothing about a certificate not yet being valid.

I remember that certificate-related errors in Node.js often relate to TLS/SSL issues. For example, ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID happens when there's a mismatch in the subjectAltNames. But that's not the same as a certificate not being valid yet.

Maybe CERT_NOT_YET_VALID is related to the validity period of a certificate. Certificates have a start and end date, and if a client tries to use a certificate before it's valid, it could cause an error. However, the context provided doesn't mention this specific error.

I should check if there's any indirect reference. Looking through the context again, I don't see any mention of certificate validity periods or such an error code. It seems the context focuses on other types of errors like encoding issues, unknown credentials, and system errors.

Since the context doesn't include CERT_NOT_YET_VALID, I can't provide an answer based on the given information. It's possible that this error isn't covered in the provided document, or it might be a less common error not listed here.

I keep scrolling and notice sections on TLS-related errors, such as ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID and ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE. These seem related to TLS certificate issues. 

Wait, the user is asking about a certificate error, so maybe it's related to TLS. I continue searching for keywords like ""CERT"" or ""certificate."" 

Further down, I find ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID, which is about the host name/IP not matching the subjectAltNames in the certificate. Then, there's a mention of ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE concerning the Diffie-Hellman key length.

So, the error occurs when there's an attempt to access a restricted resource. The context also mentions that this error doesn't use the regular ERR_* convention to be compatible with the web platform's AbortError. 

I should make sure I only use the information from the context without adding anything extra. So, the answer should clearly state that ERR_ACCESS_DENIED happens when accessing a restricted resource, like when using process.binding, and that it's compatible with AbortError on the web.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out what the ERR_ACCESS_DENIED error is in Node.js version 15.14.0 and when it happens. Let me look through the context provided to find the relevant information.

First, I'll search for ""ERR_ACCESS_DENIED"" in the context. I see several sections with that heading. It says it's a special error triggered when Node.js tries to access a resource restricted by the policy manifest. For example, when using process.binding. 

I also notice mentions that this error is part of Node.js's error handling related to restricted resources. There's some repetition in the context, but the main point is that it's about accessing restricted resources, possibly due to permission issues as per the policy manifest. 

I don't see any other specific circumstances mentioned beyond accessing restricted resources, so I'll focus on that.

**Answer:**  
The `ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR` error occurs when using `fs.cp()` to copy a directory to a non-directory, such as a file or symlink.",1,"<think>
Okay, so the user is asking about the conditions under which the ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR error occurs in Node.js version 16.20.2. I remember that this error is related to the fs.cp() function. Let me think about what I know about this error.

From what I recall, fs.cp() is used for copying files or directories. I think this specific error happens when you try to copy a directory to a destination that isn't a directory. So, if the destination is a file, a symlink, or something else that's not a directory, this error would be thrown.

Looking at the context provided, there are multiple mentions of ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR. Each time, it's described as an attempt to copy a directory to a non-directory using fs.cp(). It also mentions that this error was added in version v16.7.0. Since the user is asking about version 16.20.2, which is newer, this error should still apply.

I should make sure I'm not adding any speculative information. The context clearly states that the error occurs when using fs.cp() to copy a directory to a non-directory, such as a file or symlink. So, the conditions are pretty straightforward.

I need to present this information clearly, stating that the error occurs when attempting to copy a directory to a non-directory using fs.cp(). I should also note the version it was added in, which is v16.7.0, and confirm that it's relevant to version 16.20.2 as well.

So, putting it all together, the answer should explain the error in the context of using fs.cp() and the specific conditions that trigger it.

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH. I see several instances where this error is described. 

In one section, it says, ""Response body size doesn't match with the specified content-length header value."" That seems to directly answer the question. I don't see any additional details beyond that, so the answer is pretty straightforward.

I should make sure there's no other conflicting information, but it looks consistent across the context. So, the error occurs when there's a mismatch between the actual response body size and the Content-Length header specified.

Version-Specific Content Retrieval,what is the stability of assert.deepEqual() in Node.js version 15.14.0?,"In Node.js v15.14.0, assert.deepEqual() is marked as deprecated (Stability: 0 - Deprecated).",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the stability of assert.deepEqual() in Node.js version 15.14.0. Let me start by looking through the provided context.

First, I see that the context includes information about the assert module in Node.js, specifically version 15.14.0. It mentions that the stability of the module is marked as 2 - Stable. That's a good starting point.

I remember that stability in Node.js is rated on a scale where 0 is experimental and 3 is legacy. A rating of 2 means it's considered stable, so that's positive.

Looking deeper, the context talks about strict assertion mode. It says that in strict mode, functions like assert.deepEqual() work the same as assert.deepStrictEqual(). This might imply that the behavior is consistent and well-established, which supports the idea of stability.

There are also mentions of changes in various versions, like v9.9.0, v12.16.2, and v13.9.0, where strict assertion mode was introduced and modified. However, the context for v15.14.0 specifically states that the stability is 2 - Stable, which suggests that any past changes have been settled and the function is now reliable.

I don't see any information in the context that suggests assert.deepEqual() is unstable or deprecated in version 15.14.0. In fact, the emphasis on strict mode and error diffs indicates that the function's behavior is well-defined and tested.

So, putting it all together, the stability of assert.deepEqual() in Node.js version 15.14.0 is Stable.

It is recommended to use `assert.notDeepStrictEqual()` instead.,1,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the stability of assert.deepEqual() in Node.js version 14.21.3. Let me start by looking through the provided context. 

First, I see that the context includes several sections about different Node.js versions, including 14.21.3. In the section for version 14.21.3, there's a mention of stability. It says, ""Stability: 2 - Stable."" This seems to refer to the assert module as a whole.

I also notice that the context discusses strict and legacy assertion modes. In strict mode, assert.deepEqual() works the same as assert.deepStrictEqual(), which is stable. However, the question is specifically about the stability of assert.deepEqual() in version 14.21.3.

Looking through the context, I don't see any specific mentions of assert.deepEqual() being unstable or having a different stability rating than the module itself. Since the assert module in 14.21.3 is marked as stable, it's reasonable to conclude that assert.deepEqual() shares that stability rating unless stated otherwise.

I should make sure there are no sections that indicate a different stability for assert.deepEqual(). Scanning through, I don't find any such information. Therefore, the stability of assert.deepEqual() in Node.js 14.21.3 is the same as the module's stability, which is stable.

Version-Specific Content Retrieval,How is the assert module imported in Node.js version 17.9.1?,"In Node.js, when using CommonJS modules, you can import the assert module in two ways depending on whether you want standard or strict assertion behavior.

```javascript
import assert from 'node:assert';
```

This method is consistent across the provided context and is supported in version 17.9.1.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out how the assert module is imported in Node.js version 17.9.1. Let me start by recalling what I know about Node.js modules. I remember that modules can be imported using require() or ES6 imports. The assert module is a core module, so it's built-in and doesn't need to be installed separately.

Looking at the context provided, I see multiple sections about different Node.js versions, each describing the assert module. The versions listed include 17.9.1, which is the one the user is asking about. In the context for version 17.9.1, it mentions that the `node:assert` module provides assertion functions. 

I also notice that starting from version 15.0.0, the strict assertion mode was exposed as `require('node:assert/strict')`. However, the user's question is about the general import of the assert module, not specifically the strict mode. 

In the context, each version section says something like, ""The `node:assert` module provides a set of assertion functions..."" which suggests that the module is imported using the `node:` prefix. So, in Node.js, when you want to import a core module, you can use either `require('assert')` or `require('node:assert')`. The `node:` prefix is a more explicit way to specify that it's a Node.js core module.

Therefore, in version 17.9.1, the assert module can be imported using either `const assert = require('assert');` or `const assert = require('node:assert');`. Both methods should work, but using `node:assert` makes it clear that it's a built-in module.

I don't see any information in the context that suggests a different import method for version 17.9.1, so I can conclude that the standard way applies here.
</think>

The `assert` module in Node.js version 17.9.1 can be imported using:

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
```

or explicitly as a Node.js core module:

```javascript
const assert = require('node:assert');

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');

### For Strict Assertion Mode:
If you want to use strict assertion mode, you can import it as follows:

Okay, I need to figure out how the assert module is imported in Node.js version 18.20.8. Let me start by looking through the provided context to find relevant information.

First, I'll search for mentions of Node.js version 18.20.8. I see a section labeled ""Version 18.20.8"" which states that the node:assert module is used. It mentions that the module provides assertion functions and refers to strict assertion mode.

Looking further, I find that the assert module can be imported using require('node:assert'). There's also a note about strict assertion mode, which is exposed as require('node:assert/strict') starting from version 15.0.0. Since 18.20.8 is a higher version, this method should still apply.

I don't see any alternative import methods for the assert module in version 18.20.8. The context doesn't mention any deprecations or changes to the import syntax for this version. Therefore, the standard way to import the module should suffice.

So, the correct way to import the assert module in Node.js 18.20.8 is using require('node:assert').

Looking at the context, I see multiple sections labeled with different Node.js versions. Each section starts with a version number like ""Version 23.11.0"" and then discusses various errors in Node.js. I'll go through each section to list out all the versions mentioned.

First, I see Version 23.11.0. Then, there's Version 17.9.1, followed by Version 18.20.8, Version 22.14.0, Version 21.7.3, Version 15.14.0, and Version 19.9.0. That's seven versions so far.

Alright, so I need to figure out the latest Node.js version mentioned in the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of Node.js versions. I see several sections labeled with different versions like 18.20.8, 22.14.0, 17.9.1, 15.14.0, 23.11.0, 21.7.3, etc. These versions are listed under various error categories and assert modules.

Looking more closely, I notice that the context includes a section titled ""Node.js: Errors"" with version 23.11.0. This seems to be one of the higher versions mentioned. There's also a version 22.14.0 in another error section, which is also quite recent.

I'll check if there's any version higher than 23.11.0. Scanning further, I don't see any versions beyond that. So, 23.11.0 appears to be the latest version referenced in the context.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other higher versions. The context also mentions versions like 20.19.0 and 17.9.1, but those are lower than 23.11.0. Therefore, 23.11.0 is the most recent Node.js version in the provided information.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out the oldest Node.js version mentioned in the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I see that there are multiple sections about different Node.js versions and their features. The context includes information about various versions like v20.10.0, v22.14.0, v17.9.1, and others. However, I'm looking for the earliest version mentioned.

I notice a section under the assert module that says it was introduced in v0.1.21. This seems to be a very early version. I'll check if there are any other versions mentioned that are older than this, but I don't see any. Most other versions are in the teens or higher, like v9.9.0, v12.16.2, etc.

So, v0.1.21 is the earliest version I can find in the context. It's mentioned as the version when the assert module was introduced, which suggests it's one of the first versions of Node.js. There's no mention of any versions before this, so I can conclude that v0.1.21 is the oldest Node.js version referred to here.

Okay, so the question is asking whether Node.js version 21.7.3 exists in the system. I need to answer this using only the provided context. Let me look through the context carefully.

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of Node.js versions. I see multiple sections talking about different versions like 14.21.3, 22.14.0, 17.9.1, 20.19.0, 18.20.8, 19.9.0, 16.20.2, and 23.11.0. Each of these sections starts with a version number and some details about the assert module or error types.

Wait, I also notice a section that starts with ""Version 21.7.3"". That's the version we're looking for. It mentions that this version includes various error categories, specifically standard JavaScript errors, system errors, and user-specified errors. So, version 21.7.3 is indeed present in the context.

Additionally, in the 'kg_rels' section, there are several relations listed. One of them is ""21.7.3 - HAS_VERSION(Version 21.7.3 includes various error categories.) -> Standard JavaScript errors"". This further confirms that version 21.7.3 is part of the context and is associated with error handling in Node.js.

Okay, so the user is asking if Node.js version 13.0.0 exists in the system. Let me look through the provided context to find any mention of this version.

I see multiple sections in the context that list various Node.js versions. Each section starts with a version number, like Version 23.11.0, Version 18.20.8, and so on. I'll go through each one to check for 13.0.0.

Looking at the versions listed: 23.11.0, 18.20.8, 15.14.0, 22.14.0, 19.9.0, 20.19.0, 17.9.1, 16.20.2, 21.7.3. I don't see 13.0.0 here. 

There's also a part that talks about strict assertion mode, mentioning versions like v13.9.0 and v12.16.2, but again, no 13.0.0. 

I'll check the rest of the context, but it seems focused on error types and the assert module, not on version 13.0.0. There's no explicit mention of Node.js version 13.0.0 in the provided context. 

So, based on the given information, I can conclude that version 13.0.0 isn't listed here. Therefore, it doesn't exist in the system as per the context.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether Node.js version 5.2.3 exists in the system based on the provided context. Let me start by understanding the question and the context given.

The question is straightforward: Does Node.js version 5.2.3 exist? The context provided is a detailed list of various Node.js versions along with information about different errors and modules. 

Looking through the context, I see multiple versions listed, such as 19.9.0, 20.19.0, 15.14.0, 17.9.1, and so on. Each of these versions is mentioned in the context as part of the Node.js documentation related to errors. 

I'll go through each section of the context to check for any mention of version 5.2.3. The context starts with several Node.js versions, all of which are much higher than 5.2.3. For example, the earliest version I see is 15.14.0, which is version 15, way beyond 5. 

Additionally, the context includes information about the assert module and various error types, but again, the versions associated with these modules are higher than 5.2.3. There's no section or mention of version 5.x.x, let alone 5.2.3.

I should also consider if the context might have version numbers in a different format or if there's a typo. However, version numbers in the context are clearly stated, and none of them are in the 5.x.x range. 

Since the context doesn't mention version 5.2.3 at all, it's safe to conclude that this version isn't present in the system as per the provided information.

Okay, I need to determine whether Node.js version 3.5.5 exists in the system based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

Looking at the context, I see multiple sections about different Node.js versions. The versions mentioned include 20.19.0, 22.14.0, 17.9.1, 19.9.0, 21.7.3, 15.14.0, 23.11.0, 18.20.8, and 16.20.2. Each of these sections talks about various error categories and other features related to each version.

I'm specifically looking for version 3.5.5. I'll scan through each version listed. I don't see 3.5.5 mentioned anywhere in the context. The versions listed are all much higher, starting from 15.14.0 and going up to 23.11.0. There's no section or mention of a version as low as 3.5.5.

Additionally, the context provides details about the assert module, error types, and stability information, but again, no reference to version 3.5.5. Since the context only includes versions from 15.x.x and above, and 3.5.5 is much older, it's clear that this version isn't present in the provided information.

Therefore, based on the context given, Node.js version 3.5.5 does not exist in the system.

Then there's Spark 3.5.4, released on December 20, 2024. Another version is Spark 3.4.4, released on October 27, 2024. Additionally, there's a preview release of Spark 4.0 mentioned, which was made available on September 26, 2024.

I should make sure I haven't missed any other versions. Scanning through the context again, I don't see any other specific version numbers mentioned beyond these four. So, the available versions are 3.5.5, 3.5.4, 3.4.4, and the 4.0 preview.

Okay, so I need to figure out the latest Apache Spark version in the system based on the provided context. Let me start by carefully reading through the context to find any mentions of Spark versions and their release dates.

Looking at the context, I see multiple entries under ""Latest News."" The first entry is ""Spark 3.5.5 released"" with the date February 27, 2025. Then there's ""Spark 3.5.4 released"" on December 20, 2024, and ""Spark 3.4.4 released"" on October 27, 2024. There's also a preview release of Spark 4.0 on September 26, 2024.

I need to determine which of these is the latest. Since Spark 3.5.5 was released on February 27, 2025, which is the most recent date, it should be the latest version. The preview release of Spark 4.0 is mentioned, but it's a preview, not a final release, so it's not considered the latest stable version.

Additionally, the context includes information about built-in libraries and other details, but the key focus is on the release dates. The latest stable version is Spark 3.5.5, as it's the most recently released version without any preview status.

I see mentions of Spark 3.5.5, Spark 3.5.4, Spark 3.4.4, and a preview release of Spark 4.0. The preview is noted as being released on September 26, 2024, which is earlier than the other releases. However, the question is about the oldest version, not the release date.

Looking at the version numbers, Spark 3.4.4 is the earliest version listed. It was released on October 27, 2024. There's no mention of any versions prior to 3.4.4 in the context provided. The other versions, like 3.5.4 and 3.5.5, are newer releases, and Spark 4.0 is a preview, which is a future version.

Okay, I need to figure out whether Apache Spark version 3.7.0 exists in the system based on the provided context. Let me start by looking through the context carefully.

First, I'll scan the context for any mentions of Spark versions. I see several release notes and version numbers listed. The context mentions Spark 3.5.5, 3.5.4, 3.4.4, and a preview release of Spark 4.0. 

Looking at the release dates, Spark 3.5.5 was released on February 27, 2025, Spark 3.5.4 on December 20, 2024, and Spark 3.4.4 on October 27, 2024. There's also a preview release of Spark 4.0 on September 26, 2024.

I don't see any mention of a version 3.7.0 in the context. The versions listed are 3.4.4, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, and 4.0 preview. Since version 3.7.0 isn't listed among these, it likely doesn't exist in the system as per the given information.

Therefore, based on the context provided, Apache Spark version 3.7.0 does not exist in the system.
</think>

No, Apache Spark version 3.7.0 does not exist in the system. The context mentions versions 3.4.4, 3.5.4, 3.5.5, and a preview release of 4.0, but there is no mention of version 3.7.0.

**Answer:**  
No, Apache Spark version 3.7.0 does not exist in the system.",1,"Apache Spark version 3.7.0 does not exist in the system. The available versions are 2.4.7, 3.3.4, 3.4.4, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, and 3.5.5.",1
Version Listing & Inquiry,Does the Apache version 20.19.0 exist in the system?,No,The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to determine if Apache version 20.19.0 exists in the system based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.

Looking at the context, I see a lot of information about Node.js errors, specifically mentioning Version 20.19.0. It talks about different error categories like standard JavaScript errors, system errors, and user-specified errors. It also mentions that Node.js version 20.19.0 includes these error categories.

However, the question is about Apache, not Node.js. I need to check if there's any mention of Apache version 20.19.0. Scanning through the context, I see references to Apache Spark, the Apache Software Foundation, and various Spark versions like 3.4.4, 3.5.4, etc. There's also discussion about Java version 17.0.14 and Jetty upgrades, but nothing about Apache HTTP Server versions.

The context provided seems to focus more on Node.js and Apache Spark rather than the Apache HTTP Server. Since the question is about Apache version 20.19.0, and there's no mention of such a version in the context, I can conclude that it doesn't exist in the system based on the given information.

So, the answer is that Apache version 20.19.0 does not exist in the system according to the context provided.
</think>

Apache version 20.19.0 does not exist in the system. The context provided refers to Node.js version 20.19.0 and various Apache Spark versions, but there is no mention of Apache HTTP Server version 20.19.0.

Answer: No, Apache version 20.19.0 does not exist in the system.",1,"Based on the analysis, Apache HTTP Server version 20.19.0 does not exist. The versioning typically follows a major.minor.patch format, with major versions around 2.x. Version 20.19.0 is unusually high and likely incorrect.

It was released on October 27, 2024, as a maintenance release containing security and correctness fixes. This information is consistently mentioned across multiple source files in the provided context.",1,"<think>
Alright, I need to determine whether Apache Spark version 3.4.4 exists in the system based on the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.

First, I'll scan through the text to find any mentions of Spark 3.4.4. I see multiple lines that say ""Spark 3.4.4 released (/news/spark-3-4-4-released.html) (Oct 27, 2024)"". This indicates that version 3.4.4 was indeed released on October 27, 2024.

Additionally, in the kg_rels section, there are several entries that confirm Spark 3.4.4. For example, ""Spark - RELEASED_VERSION(Spark version 3.4.4 released) -> 3.4.4"" and ""Spark 3.4.4 - HAS_VERSION(Spark 3.4.4 is the version of the software release.) -> 3.4.4"". These lines further support that version 3.4.4 exists.

There's also a mention of the release date in the kg_rels: ""3.4.4 - HAS_RELEASE_DATE(Release date for Spark version 3.4.4) -> Dec 20, 2024"" and another line stating ""Spark 3.4.4 - RELEASED(Spark 3.4.4 released on Oct 27, 2024) -> Oct 27, 2024"". This shows that the version was released on October 27, 2024.

Okay, so I need to figure out the latest Bootstrap version mentioned in the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step. 

Looking at the context, I see multiple releases listed. The first one is v5.3.5, which was released by mdo last week. It mentions a hot fix for a regression related to Autoprefixer and includes two commits: one fixing floating labels on Firefox and another bumping the version to 5.3.5. 

Then there's v5.2.3, which is much older, released on November 22, 2022. That's clearly not the latest. Next, I see v5.3.3, released on February 20, 2024, with some fixes related to color modes. 

Further down, there's v5.3.2 from September 14, 2023, dealing with Sass deprecations, and v5.3.1 from July 26, 2023, with color mode improvements. 

Then, I come across v5.3.4, which was released last week as well. It includes several updates and fixes, like updating fixtureId for consistency, documentation improvements, and various bug fixes. 

Wait, but the context also mentions that v5.3.5 was released last week by mdo. It's the most recent one, so that should be the latest version. 

I should make sure there isn't a newer version beyond v5.3.5, but from the context, it seems v5.3.5 is the latest. It was released after v5.3.4 and addresses specific issues like floating labels in Firefox.

Okay, so I need to figure out the oldest Bootstrap version mentioned in the provided context. Let me start by going through the context carefully. I see multiple releases listed, like v5.3.3, v5.2.3, v5.3.5, and so on. Each of these seems to be a version 5 release. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the oldest version. So I need to look for the earliest version number mentioned here. Let me list out the versions I see: 5.3.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.2, 5.3.1, and 5.3.4. 

Looking at these, the versions are all in the 5.x range. The numbers after the decimal are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the oldest among these would be the smallest number. The smallest version number here is 5.1, but wait, I don't see 5.1 in the context. The earliest I see is 5.2.3, which is from November 22, 2022. 

Wait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context starts with v5.3.3, then goes to v5.2.3, then v5.3.5, and so on. It doesn't mention any versions before 5.2.3. So 5.2.3 is the oldest one listed here.

Okay, so the user is asking if the system is aware of Bootstrap version 1.2.3. I need to check the provided context to see if there's any mention of this specific version. Let me go through the context step by step.

Looking at the context, I see multiple Bootstrap releases mentioned: v5.2.3, v5.3.1, v5.3.2, v5.3.3, v5.3.4, and v5.3.5. Each of these has details about their release dates, contributors, and changes made. 

I'm specifically looking for any reference to version 1.2.3. Scanning through the text, I don't see any section or line that mentions Bootstrap 1.2.3. All the versions listed are in the 5.x.x range, which suggests that the context provided is focused on more recent releases of Bootstrap.

Additionally, the context includes information about various fixes, assets, and features related to these versions, but again, nothing points to version 1.2.3. It's possible that version 1.2.3 is much older and not covered in the given context, or it might not exist in the project's history as per the provided data.

Okay, I need to determine whether the system is aware of Bootstrap version 5.3.4. Let me look through the provided context to find any mentions of this version.

First, I'll scan the context for ""v5.3.4"". I see a section titled ""Releases v5.3.4"". That suggests that version 5.3.4 exists in the context. 

Looking at that section, it provides details about the release. It mentions the release date as ""last week"" and the committer as ""github-actions"". There are several commits and changes listed, such as updates to documentation, fixes, and dependency updates. 

Additionally, there are other mentions of version 5.3.4 in different parts of the context, like in the commit counts and changes between versions. This indicates that version 5.3.4 is recognized and documented within the system.

Therefore, the system is indeed aware of Bootstrap version 5.3.4.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the system is aware of version 3.6 of Apache Spark. Let me start by looking through the provided context. 

First, I'll scan the news releases. I see mentions of Spark 3.5.5, 3.5.4, and 3.4.4. These were released in February, December, and October of 2024 respectively. There's also a preview release of Spark 4.0 from September 2024. 

I'm looking for any mention of version 3.6. The context lists releases up to 3.5.5 and then jumps to a preview of 4.0. There's no release note, download link, or any other information about a 3.6 version. 

Additionally, the built-in libraries and other sections don't indicate any updates or references to 3.6. All the releases mentioned are either 3.5.x, 3.4.x, or the upcoming 4.0. 

Since there's no information about Spark 3.6 in the context, it seems the system isn't aware of that version. The latest stable release mentioned is 3.5.5, and the next major version is 4.0 in preview. Therefore, the answer is that the system does not recognize Spark 3.6.

Okay, I need to figure out what changed in the Error class in Node.js version 17.9.1 regarding the constructor. Let me start by looking through the provided context.

The context mentions that the Error class has a constructor `new Error(message[, options])`. It also lists some versions and their changes. I see that in version v9.9.0, the `error` parameter can now be an object. In version v4.2.0, the `error` parameter can be an arrow function. 

Wait, but the question is about version 17.9.1. I don't see any specific changes mentioned for version 17.9.1 in the context. It talks about other versions like v4.2.0 and v9.9.0, but not 17.9.1. 

So, based on the context, there are no changes mentioned for the Error class constructor in version 17.9.1. The context only provides information about earlier versions, not 17.9.1. Therefore, I can conclude that no specific changes were made to the Error constructor in that version according to the given context.

This is the earliest version in the provided context where the OpenSSL-related error properties are documented. 

Answer: The changes about OpenSSL error codes were introduced in Node.js version 16.20.2.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out with which Node.js version the changes about OpenSSL error codes were introduced. Let me look through the provided context to find any mentions of Node.js versions related to OpenSSL errors.

Looking through the context, I see several error codes mentioned, like ERR_CRYPTO_OPERATION_FAILED, ERR_CRYPTO_PBKDF2_ERROR, and others. Each of these has a section, and some include a YAML block with an 'added' field. For example, under ERR_CRYPTO_OPERATION_FAILED, there's a YAML comment that says 'added: v15.0.0'. That suggests this particular error was added in Node.js version 15.0.0.

I don't see any other Node.js version numbers mentioned in the context related to OpenSSL error codes. Most of the other error codes don't have specific version information attached to them. So, based on the information given, the only version mentioned is v15.0.0, which is where ERR_CRYPTO_OPERATION_FAILED was introduced.

Therefore, I can conclude that the changes about OpenSSL error codes were introduced in Node.js version 15.0.0.

Change Retrieval (i),With what Node.js version was error code ERR_ACCESS_DENIED added?,The error code ERR_ACCESS_DENIED was added in Node.js version 16.20.2.,The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out with which Node.js version the error code ERR_ACCESS_DENIED was added. I'm looking at the provided context, which seems to be a mix of HTML and YAML content describing various Node.js error codes. 

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mention of ERR_ACCESS_DENIED. I notice several sections with the heading ""ERR_ACCESS_DENIED"". Each of these sections describes the error as being triggered when Node.js tries to access a restricted resource, such as when using process.binding. 

Looking more closely, I see that each section about ERR_ACCESS_DENIED is followed by some YAML-like comments. One of them says ""<!-- YAML added: v15.0.0 -->"". This suggests that the error code was added in Node.js version 15.0.0. 

I should double-check to make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere. I see that other errors like ABORT_ERR are mentioned with their respective versions, but for ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, the only version I see mentioned is v15.0.0. 

Therefore, I can conclude that ERR_ACCESS_DENIED was added in Node.js version 15.0.0.

This version provided a more detailed description of the error, which occurs when attempting to copy a directory to a non-directory using `fs.cp()`. 

**Answer:**  
The version that introduced a more detailed description of the error code `ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR` is **v16.7.0**.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which version of Node.js introduced a change for a more detailed description of the error code ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking about the version where this specific error's description became more detailed.

Looking at the provided context, I see several mentions of ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR. Each section about this error has a comment indicating when it was added. For example, one part says:

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
-->

And another part in the context mentions:

ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR - HAS_VERSION(The error ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR was added in version v16.7.0.) -> v16.7.0

So, it seems that this error was added in Node.js version 16.7.0. The question is about when the description became more detailed. Since the error itself was introduced in 16.7.0, it's likely that the detailed description was part of that version. There's no mention of the description being updated in a later version, so I can conclude that the change happened in v16.7.0.
</think>

The error code ERR_FS_CP_DIR_TO_NON_DIR was introduced in Node.js version **v16.7.0**, which included a more detailed description of the error.

Change Retrieval (i),When was the change about the newly added error code ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH introduced to Node.js?,The change about the newly added error code `ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH` was introduced to Node.js in version 16.20.2.,The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to figure out when the change about the newly added error code ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH was introduced to Node.js. Let me go through the context provided to see if I can find any relevant information.

First, I'll scan through the context to look for any mentions of ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH. I see several error codes discussed, like ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT, ERR_HTTP_INVALID_HEADER_VALUE, and others, but none of them are ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH. 

Looking further, the context talks about various errors, their descriptions, and some changes related to header sizes and limits. For example, there's a mention of HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH related to exceeding the max header size, but that's a different error code.

I also notice sections about error codes like ERR_OPERATION_FAILED and ERR_NO_LONGER_SUPPORTED, but again, no mention of ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH. The context includes details about error messages and when certain errors were added, like ERR_OPERATION_FAILED in v15.0.0, but nothing specific about the error in question.

Since I can't find any direct or indirect references to ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH in the provided context, I have to conclude that the information isn't available here. Without explicit details about when this error was added, I can't provide a specific version or date.
</think>

The context provided does not mention the error code ERR_HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH or any information related to its introduction in Node.js. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

Answer: No, the CallTracker object was introduced in Node.js Assert version 14.2.0, not as a new feature in version 14.21.3.",0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if the CallTracker object was introduced as a new feature in Node.js Assert version 14.21.3. Let me start by looking through the provided context to find any information about the CallTracker.

First, I see that the context mentions the CallTracker class in several places. There's a section that talks about the stability of this feature. It says that the feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, suggesting that it was added in a past version.

Looking at the YAML sections, I notice that under the `new assert.CallTracker()` method, there are two added versions listed: v14.2.0 and v12.19.0. This indicates that the CallTracker was added in these versions.

Now, the user is asking about version 14.21.3. Since the CallTracker was added in v14.2.0, which is earlier than 14.21.3, it means that in version 14.21.3, the CallTracker was already present. Therefore, it wasn't a new feature introduced in that specific version but was added earlier.

Additionally, the context mentions that the feature is deprecated, which further supports that it was present before 14.21.3 and is being phased out.
</think>

The CallTracker object was not introduced as a new feature in Node.js Assert version 14.21.3. It was added in earlier versions, specifically v14.2.0 and v12.19.0. By version 14.21.3, it was already present but marked as deprecated.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when new sample code for WeakMap and WeakSet comparison was added to Node.js Assert. The question is asking specifically about the addition of this sample code. I'll need to go through the provided context to find the relevant information.

Looking at the context, I see multiple sections that mention WeakMap and WeakSet. There are code snippets showing how assert.deepStrictEqual works with them. For example, there's a part where it shows that comparing different WeakMap instances fails even if they have the same content. Similarly, comparing WeakSet instances in the same way also fails. This indicates that the comparison doesn't rely on their values but rather on reference equality.

I'm scanning through the context to find any mention of when this feature was added. The context includes various links to MDN Web Docs, references to different assertion methods, and some version mentions like v0.1.21, v12.16.0, v13.6.0, etc. However, none of these directly state the version when the WeakMap and WeakSet comparison was added to Node.js Assert.

Wait, there's a part in the context that says ""assert.deepEqual() was added in version v0.1.21."" But that's about deepEqual, not deepStrictEqual. Another mention is about v16.0.0 and v18.0.0, but I'm not sure if that's related to the WeakMap and WeakSet comparison.

I also notice that the context links to MDN Web Docs for WeakMap and WeakSet, but those are general references, not specific to Node.js versions. There's no explicit mention of the version when the sample code was added for WeakMap and WeakSet in the Assert module.

Since the context doesn't provide a specific version or date, I can't pinpoint exactly when it was added. It seems the information isn't present in the given context, so I can't provide a precise answer based on the available data.

Okay, so I need to figure out when the `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual` method was added to Node.js's Assert module. I'm looking through the provided context, which seems to be a mix of documentation and code examples. 

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual`. I see several examples where this method is used, like comparing objects and arrays. But I'm specifically looking for the version it was added in.

I remember that in Node.js, new methods are often documented with the version they were added. So I'll look for any lines that mention the version number in relation to `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual`. 

Looking through the context, I spot a section that says:

```
assert.partialDeepStrictEqual - ADDED_IN_VERSION(The version in which the function was added) -> v22.13.0
```

This seems to indicate that the method was added in version 22.13.0. I don't see any other version numbers mentioned for this specific method, so I'm pretty confident that's the correct version. 

I don't recall any earlier versions having this method, and since the context doesn't mention it being added in an earlier version, I'll go with 22.13.0 as the answer.
</think>

The `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual` method was added to Node.js Assert in version **v22.13.0**.",0,"The `assert.partialDeepStrictEqual` method was added to Node.js in version 22.14.0.

Change Retrieval (i),Since when are the modules imported with node: syntax in Node.js Assert?,The `node:` prefix for importing built-in modules in Node.js Assert was introduced in version 16.,The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, I need to answer the question: ""Since when are the modules imported with node\: syntax in Node.js Assert?"" 

First, I'll look through the provided context to find any information related to the node:assert module and its import syntax. 

I notice that the context mentions the node:assert module in several places, but I'm specifically looking for when the node: syntax was introduced. 

I see that in the context, under the ""node:assert"" module, it's mentioned that it was introduced in version v0.1.21. However, I also see that strict assertion mode was added in v9.9.0 and exposed as require('node:assert/strict') in v15.0.0.

Wait, but the question is about the node: syntax, which is a URL-like import syntax. I recall that Node.js started supporting this syntax in certain versions, but I need to check the context for exact information.

Looking through the context, I find that the node:assert module is described as providing assertion functions and that it's imported using the node:assert syntax. However, the context doesn't explicitly state when this syntax was introduced. 

I see that the module was introduced in v0.1.21, but the node: syntax might have been introduced later. Since the context doesn't provide a specific version for the syntax change, I might have to infer based on the information given.

I also notice that the strict assertion mode was exposed as require('node:assert/strict') starting from v15.0.0, which suggests that the node: syntax was in use around that time.

So, putting it together, the node:assert module has been around since v0.1.21, but the node: syntax for importing it was likely introduced or became standard around v15.0.0 when strict mode was exposed using that syntax.
</think>

The modules imported with the node\: syntax in Node.js Assert have been available since version v0.1.21. However, the specific node:assert/strict module was exposed using this syntax starting from version v15.0.0.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the examples about partialDeepStrictEqual were changed in any Node.js Assert version. Let me look through the context provided.

First, I'll scan through the context to find any mentions of partialDeepStrictEqual. I see that there's a section about assert.partialDeepStrictEqual. It includes some examples where it's used, and the results are either OK or throw an AssertionError.

Looking further, I notice that the context mentions the version changes. Specifically, it says that assert.partialDeepStrictEqual was added in version v22.13.0. That's a clear indication that this function was introduced in that version.

I also check if there are any other changes mentioned about this function in different versions. The context doesn't mention any further changes beyond its addition in v22.13.0. So, it seems that the only change related to partialDeepStrictEqual is its introduction in that version, without any subsequent modifications to its examples.

Therefore, the answer is that examples about partialDeepStrictEqual were added in Node.js Assert version v22.13.0, and there were no changes in examples in other versions beyond that.

Okay, I need to figure out the change made to badges in Bootstrap v5.3.3 regarding text readability. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

First, I'll look for mentions of badges and text readability. Scanning through the context, I see a section under ""Color modes"" that says badges now use the .text-bg-* text utilities to ensure readability, especially in light and dark modes. This seems relevant.

I should check if this change is specific to v5.3.3. The context mentions that this change was made in v5.3.3, so it's the correct version. No other versions are noted for this particular change.

I don't see any other changes related to badges and text readability in other versions. So, the key point is the use of .text-bg-* utilities for better text contrast in both modes.

Okay, I need to figure out the change made to how color modes are handled in Bootstrap v5.3.5. Let me look through the provided context carefully. 

First, I see that in v5.3.3, there was a fix related to color modes where importing _variables-dark.scss was made automatic. So, in that version, _variables.scss automatically imports _variables-dark.scss, which was a breaking change fix. 

Now, looking specifically at v5.3.5, the context mentions that badges now use .text-bg-* utilities to ensure text is readable, especially with customized colors in different modes. This suggests that the way color modes handle text contrast has been improved for better readability.

Additionally, the color-modes.js script was fixed to handle cases where the OS is set to light mode, which indicates better handling of system-level color modes without breaking existing setups.

So, putting it together, the main change in v5.3.5 is allowing color customization for color modes, enhancing text readability, and ensuring the color-modes.js script works smoothly across different system settings.

Alright, I need to figure out which dependency was upgraded in Apache Spark 3.5.5. Let me start by looking through the provided context carefully.

First, I'll scan the context for any sections that mention Spark 3.5.5 specifically. I see a part titled ""Spark Release 3.5.5"" which mentions that it's a maintenance release with some dependency upgrades. 

Looking closer, under the ""Dependency Changes"" section for Spark 3.5.5, I find [SPARK-45885] which states that ORC was upgraded to version 1.7.10. Additionally, there's another mention under a different section about upgrading Avro to 1.11.4 in Spark 3.5.5, linked to [SPARK-50886]. 

Wait, but I should verify if both of these are part of the 3.5.5 release. The context seems to indicate that both ORC and Avro were upgraded, but I need to make sure they're both in the same release. 

Yes, both SPARK-45885 and SPARK-50886 are listed under the Spark 3.5.5 section in different parts of the context. So, it looks like both dependencies were upgraded in this release. 

Therefore, the answer should include both ORC and Avro, along with their respective versions.

This fix ensures that the selector engine can now properly manage cases where multiple IDs are present.",1,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what was fixed in the selector engine in Bootstrap v5.3.3. Let me start by looking through the provided context to find any mentions of fixes related to the selector engine specifically in that version.

First, I see that the context includes information about several Bootstrap releases, including v5.3.3, v5.3.4, v5.3.5, and others. I'll focus on v5.3.3.

Looking at the section for v5.3.3, the context mentions that it was released on Feb 20, 2024, by XhmikosR. The highlights include a fix for a breaking change related to color modes, where _variables.scss now automatically imports _variables-dark.scss. That's about Sass variables, not the selector engine.

Further down, under the ""Components"" section, there's a note about improving disabled styling for all .nav-link elements, providing both .disabled and :disabled states. This is about styling, not selectors.

Then, I see a bullet point that says: ""Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions."" This directly mentions a fix in the CSS selectors, which are part of the selector engine. So that's one fix.

Additionally, another point mentions: ""Use child combinators to avoid inheriting parent max-width and background-color."" This is about CSS selectors using child combinators, which is another selector engine fix.

I don't see any other mentions of selector engine fixes in v5.3.3. So, the two fixes are related to accordion CSS selectors and using child combinators to prevent inheritance issues.
</think>

In Bootstrap v5.3.3, the selector engine fixes include:

1. Fixing accordion CSS selectors to prevent inheritance issues when nesting accordions.
2. Using child combinators to avoid inheriting parent styles like max-width and background-color.

These changes improve the specificity and correctness of CSS selectors, enhancing overall styling consistency.",0,"In Bootstrap v5.3.3, the selector engine was fixed to address a regression that prevented it from handling multiple IDs correctly.

Alright, I need to figure out the change made to color modes in Bootstrap v5.3.3. I'll start by looking through the provided context, which includes release notes and commit details.

First, I'll search for mentions of Bootstrap v5.3.3 and color modes. The context has a section under ""Releases v5.3.3"" that highlights changes. It mentions a fix related to a breaking change with color modes. Specifically, it says that manually importing `_variables-dark.scss` is no longer necessary because `_variables.scss` now automatically imports it. However, if someone was already importing it manually, they can continue doing so without issues.

Additionally, there are other color mode improvements, like allowing `<mark>` color customization and enhancing contrast in dark mode, especially for striped tables. Badges now use `.text-bg-*` utilities for better readability across different modes.

So, the main change in v5.3.3 regarding color modes is the automatic import of `_variables-dark.scss` to fix a breaking change, along with other enhancements for better customization and readability.
</think>

The change made to the way color modes are handled in Bootstrap v5.3.3 was that `_variables.scss` now automatically imports `_variables-dark.scss`.

Okay, so I need to figure out what was refactored in the accordion CSS selectors in Bootstrap v5.3.4. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking specifically about changes made to the accordion component's CSS selectors in that version. 

Looking at the provided context, I see a lot of information about various Bootstrap releases, including v5.3.4, and the changes made in each. I'll need to scan through this to find mentions of accordion CSS selectors.

First, I'll search for keywords like ""accordion"" and ""CSS selectors"" in the context. I notice a few sections that mention accordion-related issues. For example, there's a mention of ""Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions."" That sounds relevant. 

Also, I see a note about using child combinators to avoid inheriting parent accordion's flush styles, which is issue #37508. Another point mentions refactoring accordion by merging selectors for the border-radius rule, which is #39697. 

Putting this together, it seems that in v5.3.4, the accordion's CSS selectors were refactored in two main ways: using child combinators to prevent style inheritance and merging selectors for border-radius to optimize the code. These changes likely make the accordion component more robust, especially when nested, and improve the overall structure of the CSS.

In Bootstrap v5.3.4, the accordion CSS selectors were refactored to use child combinators. This change prevents the inheritance of styles from parent accordions when they are nested. Additionally, the selectors for the border-radius rule were merged, optimizing the CSS structure.",1,"In Bootstrap v5.3.4, the accordion component underwent a refactor where the CSS selectors for the border-radius property were merged. This change aimed to consolidate multiple selectors into a single rule, enhancing code efficiency without altering the component's appearance. 

**Answer:**  
The accordion's CSS selectors for border-radius were merged to improve code efficiency.",1
Change Retrieval (e),What dependency updates were included in Bootstrap v5.3.4?,"Numerous development dependencies were updated, including terser, hugo-bin, eslint, rollup, and others.",The provided context does not contain enough information to answer this question.,0,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out what dependency updates were included in Bootstrap v5.3.4. Let me start by looking at the provided context. 

First, I'll scan through the context to find mentions of v5.3.4. I see a section labeled ""Releases v5.3.4"" which seems relevant. Under that, there's a list of changes. 

Looking at the changes, I notice a point that says ""#40888: Dependabot: switch to grouped updates"". This suggests that there was a change related to dependency management, possibly updating how dependencies are handled, maybe grouping them for better organization or efficiency.

I don't see any specific mentions of updating particular libraries or tools in the v5.3.4 section. The context does talk about other releases like v5.3.5 and v5.3.3, which include various updates and fixes, but those aren't part of v5.3.4. 

So, focusing back on v5.3.4, the only dependency-related change I can find is the switch to grouped updates via Dependabot. There might be other minor updates, but they aren't detailed here. 

I think the main dependency update in v5.3.4 is the switch to grouped updates using Dependabot. That's the key point to mention.
</think>

The dependency updates included in Bootstrap v5.3.4 were:

- **#40888: Dependabot: switch to grouped updates** - This change involved updating the dependency management process to group updates, likely improving organization or efficiency.

Alright, I need to figure out what change was made regarding the NumPy dependency in Spark Release 3.4.4. Let me go through the context provided step by step.

First, I'll look for any mentions of Spark 3.4.4. I see that it's mentioned as a maintenance release with some fixes, but nothing about dependencies there. Then, I check the ""Dependency changes"" section, but that's under Spark 3.5.4, which isn't what the user is asking about.

I scan through the entire context again, looking for keywords like ""NumPy"" or ""dependency"" near mentions of Spark 3.4.4. I don't find any specific information about NumPy in the context provided. It seems that the context focuses on other dependencies like Avro, Maven, and Okio, but NumPy isn't listed.

Since the user specifically asked about NumPy in Spark 3.4.4 and the context doesn't mention it, I have to conclude that there's no information available about changes to the NumPy dependency in that release.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which Apache release improved the behavior of the percentile_disc function. I'll start by looking through the provided context to find any mentions of the percentile_disc function or related issues.

First, I notice a section with the heading ""ApplicationMaster"" that lists several JIRA issues. One of them is SPARK-44871, which is titled ""Fix percentile_disc behaviour."" That seems directly related to the question. 

I'll check if there's any information about the release version associated with this issue. Scanning through the context, I see a section titled ""Spark 3.5.5"" which mentions it was released on Feb 27, 2025. It also notes that this is a maintenance release and includes several JIRA fixes, including SPARK-50886 which upgrades Avro. 

Looking further, under the ""Dependency changes"" section, it mentions that while it's a maintenance release, some dependencies were upgraded, pointing to JIRA for detailed changes. Another section mentions ""Spark 3.5.5"" as the latest release, so it's likely that this release includes the fix for SPARK-44871.

Additionally, in the context, there's a part that explicitly links SPARK-44871 to the fix for percentile_disc behavior, indicating that this fix is part of the Spark 3.5.5 release.

First, I see that the context includes several JIRA issues. I'm looking for any mentions of issues related to a broken query when a window is provided. 

I notice that there are two entries for [SPARK-49836]. The first one says, ""Fix possibly broken query when window is provided to window/session_window fn."" That seems relevant. The second entry repeats the same information, so it's definitely about the same issue. 

I should check if this JIRA issue is associated with Spark Release 3.5.4. Looking through the context, I see a section titled ""Spark Release 3.5.4"" which mentions that it's a maintenance release with various fixes. 

Under the ""Notable changes"" section for Spark 3.5.4, I don't see [SPARK-49836] listed. However, the issue is mentioned earlier in the context, and since the release is based on the branch-3.5 maintenance branch, it's likely included. 

I also see that [SPARK-49836] is related to [SPARK-49843] and [SPARK-49959], which are about fixing other issues, but those don't directly address the window function problem. 

So, putting it together, the issue was fixed in Spark 3.5.4 by addressing the broken query when a window is provided. The specific JIRA issue [SPARK-49836] was resolved in this release.
