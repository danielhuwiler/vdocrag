What are the four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience?,"The four categories are: Standard JavaScript errors, system errors, user-specified errors, and AssertionErrors.",Content Retrieval,"Based on the retrieved context, the four categories of errors that Node.js applications generally experience are:

1. Standard JavaScript errors, which include {EvalError}, {SyntaxError}, {RangeError}, {ReferenceError}, {TypeError}, and {URIError}.
2. System errors, which are triggered by underlying operating system constraints, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist or attempting to send data over a closed socket.
3. User-specified errors, which are triggered by application code.

How does error handling differ between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js?,"Synchronous APIs handle errors using throw and try...catch, while asynchronous APIs report errors via Promises, callbacks, or 'error' events.",Content Retrieval Complex,"Based on the retrieved context, error handling differs between synchronous and asynchronous APIs in Node.js as follows:

Synchronous APIs, which are blocking methods that do not return a Promise nor accept a callback function, use the `throw` statement to report errors. This is evident from the chunk in the source file ""errors nodejs 23.11.0.md"" which states that ""With few exceptions, _Synchronous_ APIs (any blocking method that does not return a {Promise} nor accept a `callback` function, such as `fs.readFileSync`), will use `throw` to report errors.""

On the other hand, asynchronous APIs, which are methods that accept a callback function, follow an idiomatic pattern referred to as an _error-first callback_. With this pattern, a callback function is passed to the method as an argument, and when the operation either completes or an error is raised, the callback function is called with the `Error` object (if any) passed as the first argument. If no error was raised, the first argument will be passed as `null`. This is evident from the chunks in the source files ""errors nodejs 17.9.1.md"", ""errors nodejs 15.14.0.md"", and ""errors nodejs 20.19.0.md"" which all describe the error-first callback pattern for asynchronous APIs.

What is the difference between assert.deepEqual() and assert.deepStrictEqual() in Node.js?,"assert.deepEqual() uses the == operator for comparison, which allows coercion (e.g., 1 == '1'), while assert.deepStrictEqual() uses Object.is(), which performs strict equality checks (e.g., 1 !== '1'). assert.deepStrictEqual() is recommended for more reliable assertions.",Content Retrieval Complex,"The difference between `assert.deepEqual()` and `assert.deepStrictEqual()` in Node.js is that `deepEqual()` checks for deep equality, which means it checks for both object equality and property equality, whereas `deepStrictEqual()` checks for strict deep equality, which means it checks for both object equality and property equality, and also checks for the type of the properties.

In other words, `deepEqual()` is more permissive and will consider two objects equal if they have the same properties, even if the properties have different types. On the other hand, `deepStrictEqual()` is more strict and will only consider two objects equal if they have the same properties and the properties have the same types.

For example, the following code will pass with `deepEqual()` but will throw an error with `deepStrictEqual()`:

assert.deepEqual({ a: 1, b: '2' }, { a: 1, b: 2 });
assert.deepStrictEqual({ a: 1, b: '2' }, { a: 1, b: 2 }); // throws an error

For example, in the assert module, the error.code property is set to 'ERR_ASSERTION' to indicate that the error is an assertion error.",Content Retrieval Complex,"The purpose of the `error.code` property in Node.js errors is to identify the kind of error as a string label. It is the most stable way to identify an error, as it will only change between major versions of Node.js. This property is used in assertions to provide a unique identifier for the error, allowing for more precise error handling and debugging.

In the context of assertions, `error.code` is used to specify the expected error code that should be thrown when a certain condition is not met. For example, in the `node:assert` module, you can use `assert.throws()` to test that a function throws a specific error with a certain code.",1,"The `error.code` property in Node.js serves as a string label that identifies the kind of error.

In both scenarios, the error handler is skipped.",1,"The `assert.rejects()` function in Node.js is designed to handle cases where an async function throws an error synchronously. Here's how it works:

1. **Synchronous Error Handling**: If the provided async function (`asyncFn`) throws an error synchronously, `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected Promise with that error. This allows the test to capture and verify the specific error condition immediately.

2. **Non-Promise Return Handling**: If the function does not return a Promise, `assert.rejects()` will return a rejected Promise with an `ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE` error. This ensures that the test correctly identifies when the function doesn't adhere to the expected asynchronous pattern.

3. **Error Handler Bypass**: In both scenarios, any error handlers (like `.catch()` or `try/catch` blocks) within the tested function are bypassed. This means the error is directly handled by the assertion, streamlining the testing process.

They both check if a promise does not reject or throw an error. The main difference is that `assert.doesNotReject()` is specifically designed for async/await syntax, whereas `assert.doesNotThrow()` is more general-purpose.

The context suggests that `assert.doesNotReject()` is not particularly useful because it catches a rejection and then rejects it again, which does not provide any additional benefit. Instead, it is recommended to add a comment next to the specific code path that should not reject and keep error messages as expressive as possible.

If you need to correctly compare `NaN` values, consider using `assert.deepStrictEqual()`, which uses the SameValue algorithm (like `Object.is()`), treating `NaN` as equal to itself.

**Answer:**

The `assert.strictEqual()` method in Node.js does not handle comparisons of `NaN` values correctly because it uses the strict equality operator (`===`), which returns `false` when comparing `NaN` with itself. Therefore, `assert.strictEqual(NaN, NaN)` will fail.
